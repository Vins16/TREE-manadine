1,"I love some of Lora Leigh books so when I heard of the Men of August, I was excited about reading the three books. I just finished my first one and I am sorry I bought the other two as well. Marly's Choice did not do it for me. Some hot scenes in the book but I could not get past all the ""don't say no to me"" and ""if you love me, you will do this for me"". It did not turn me on, it grossed me out. I would not recommend the book as a good read.",445
1,Something is wrong with this DVD. It doesn't have fastplay so I have to pick the episode I want each time and once the episode is over it will go back to playing the same episode over and over again. I buy lots of DVD's through amazon and I never had that problem before. It's annoying not to be able to play it all. Every 30 minutes I have to come and choose the next episode. Other then that the stories are cute- what else would you expect from a Mickey Clubhouse movie?,473
1,"The book contains good information, but it was written back in 1920-something. The wording is therefore somewhat florid, over-the-top and full of scientific terms no longer inuse today. If I were a student of plating history, this would be a fine addition to my library. Unfortunately, I was looking for something more up to date.",330
1,"AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT RUTH PRICE IS!THAT LITTLE JAZZ CLUB THAT RUTH OWNS (THAT SHE PASSES OFF AS) ANON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION IS ANYTHING BUT NON-PROFIT. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS WOMEN WHO CALLS HERSELF A MUSICIAN, AND YET RIPS OFF EVERY MUSICIAN WHO PASSES THROUGH THE JOINT. SHE IS NOT WORTHY OF ANY FORM OF RESPECT, BECAUSE SHE HAS NO RESPECT FOR HARD WORKING STRUGGLING MUSICIANS, WHOM SHE NICKELS AND DIMES TO DEATH. THE JAZZBAKERY IS A SHAM, AND RUTH PRICE OUGHT TO HANG HER HEAD IN SHAME!",498
1,"Used this pressure cooker and thought it was what I expected. On the third use I noticed a hole in the top were the over pressure plug should be , it fell out . Unable to find, so it's useless untill I order a new part. Yes it was hand washed . Checked bottom of unit and guess what.? Another product made in China! Thanks Presto.",330
1,"I HAVE TO TELL ALL OF YOU: 6 and 1/2 from the first 10 songs in CD 1 are nothing but pieces from ""Luis Bonfa plays"" and ""Jazz Samba Encore!"" and others, wrongly titled as Jobim's products. I don't understand that, since the first reviewer has bought so many bossa nova CDs, he still doesnt realize this fact.",308
1,"Why this book became a best seller is beyond me. This has to be the worst book I've read in years. I plodded through hoping something interesting would happen but it just got more ridiculous and depressing. There were no twists, or anything that redeemed the initial plot idea. Hank is a weak, stupid, brutal, and boring one-dimensional character. I found myself hoping he would eventually get what was due him in some form betrayal, torture, death.. Unfortunately the end is just as boring and depressing leaving this reader throwing it in the trash.",551
1,"Corbin does a miserable job of acting in this one. If you like gore, there is plenty of that in this film, but if you prefer scary movies to contain interesting story lines and reasonably decent acting, you may want to look elsewhere for your entertainment. If you are going to actually buy a DVD, there are better films available here on Amazon. Rent this if you must, but don't buy.",384
1,"I had this for a month, looking forward to listening to it in the car, when I discovered that this is only PART 1 of Middlemarch, that there are TWO boxes, not one. Do I want to listen to only half of the book? NO! Do I want to pay $90 to listen to the whole thing? No! So what do I do?",286
1,I bought this translation hoping it would be like the Jeruasalem Bible. While it is poetic I find it almost unuseable because of the inclusive language. I'm getting rid of this translation in favor of St Ignatius RSV 2nd Edition.,229
1,If I could give this zero stars I would. Save your money. Bought this from QVC. It broke within a month. Wrist band popped open every time I tried to take my reading. I have small wrists 6 1/2 inches and it wouldn't stay closed. Took very poor reading when you were able to get one. Not accurate. Piece of junk. Go with an omron.,329
1,"This is a good chess set for the price. The only thing messed up is the codeing is on the wrong line. When you set up a chess board the white square is on the right. If you ues the codes, KN1 to KB3, they are maked incorrectly on the board.",240
1,"As several others have noted, there is a substantial style difference between the first and second halves of this book.The simple direct elegance of the first half was replaced by quite the opposite in the second half.This is a very good book for C++.It is a far less desirable book for Visual C++.",298
1,"The manufacturer wanted to make certain these pliers come together at the tip. Rather than build pliers to a high standard and design, they simply curved them outward so that they do not come together in the middle at all -- but they do touch at the tip. It goes to show that you can either (1) cry when you buy tools because of the high price, but then be glad every time you use the tool, or (2) be glad about the low price when you purchase a tool, but then cry every time you use it. I regret that I was glad to purchase these pliers at such a low price.",558

1,"we got this as a gift for our dd. she didn't have any interest in it at all. even after she learned how to kick it...it didn't stay in place long enough for her to keep kicking it. also, you had to really hit it hard in order to get it going. the music was very loud and annoying. the first time she heard the music it scared her. the only plus side to it is that it can fold up nicely and be put away. definitly not worth to buy. i'm glad i got this as a gift and didn't buy it.",479
1,"Dissapointing! this is a great movie that my wife and I love so much, unfortunately, the recording process of this DVD is very poor, I believe it's a bootleg! my old VHS tape is clearer. It's cheap! but not worth it. Sorry, I have to return it.",244
1,This product showed promise but within a few short week the sound button broke off. I tried to fix it but the little plastic wheel was snapped in pieces. Also had another friend who had the exact same problem. I would not recommend this,236
1,"This package of beef sticks didn't exactly meet my expectations. Two things immediately came to mind when eating: 1. the beef sticks are as hard as rocks! The sticks are so hard to bite into and then chew, my jaw ends up getting sore after only one piece; definitely not good. 2. Way too salty! The flavor of the beef is masked by an undeniable taste of too much salt.I think I only eat 1-2 pieces a week, simply when I need a quick protein source; I wouldn't recommend these to people, especially if they are looking to a tasty and fun to eat snack.",550
1,"The product showed up quickly, but I was immediately put off by the condition of the box. It was beat up and had holes punctured in the side, and the lights inside had scuffs and markings on them. It is not working and this seller appears to send open box products and refurbished ones and tries to pass them off as new. Just a warning. I will update the outcome.",363
1,"I love the arrangement of the batteries, but the battery tester does not work at all. Tried it with every size battery that I have (many brand new and were in original package) it is detachable, so I am in hopes that Amazon will be able to just send me a new tester. The organizer is bolted to the wall in my garage.",316
1,"This had essentially no range for the wireless signal. Even 15 feet was too far for a connection, which makes this essentially useless as a wireless thermometer. I also did not like their buttons (the black horizontal stripes on the silver piece) - they were difficult to push - or more than they should be. Returning this to try to find one that will allow me to stand somewhere other than right next to the grill.",415
1,I am extremly dissappointed by amazon.Im from Germany and ordered this Box few days ago.I got the Gift Set today and the case was damaged.Amazon should use better packaging for Items like that when they send it to Europe.I hope i will get a replacement for that.Movie 5 StarsAmazon & Packaging no Stars,302
1,This was my second order of the same DVD. It jammed my player early on in the recording and caused a lot of problems not to mention the frustration.(both times) There is something wrong with the production of this item. You should not be selling it.,249
1,"I decided to read this because I usually enjoy Danielle Steele's books. However, I felt that this was just a bit too depressiing and mocks women who have battled cancer. I regret wasting my time reading this. The story seemed too contrived inparts and in some I was actually thinking to myself this is crap! I know a lot of people will disagree with me but I think that she is capable of better writing than this.",413
1,Ok so i purchased this VGA Box. It works and it has the nifty channels so you dont have to go through the whole uynplugging and replugging. However the graphics are ok..nothing that makes me say yeahhh! it may be my monitor its a Samsung..i dont really know i wish i could have tried it first without buying it. But it does work and i will get over the fgraphics issue,368
1,"I bought this item in preparation for my first child. I tried it 8 times on me and my husband and got a different reading each time, from 94.2 - 102.3!! I returned it the next day, don't bother!!",195
1,I didn't even bother to open the cable because when I opened the box the device had obviously been previously opened and/or used.,129
1,First one I used melted in the laminator. I now have to send it in to have it repaired. Spend your money wisely buy Scotch brand.,129
1,"The examples are too basic, the design is boring and canned. If you have any graphic design skill whatsoever, you are already ahead of this book, even if you have never touched Flash.Buy Hillman Curtis' 'Flash Web Design' for inspiration about designing in Flash and the 'Flash 4 Bible' to figure out how to accomplish it. But don't waste your money on this one.",362
1,"The story is wonderful, this particular edition with its trash cover absolutely desecrates the story and the heroine. Every child should read this story and spend time in its space of wonder and innocence, for the moment free from the sexed-up hype the cover represents.Get the book for free at Project Gutenberg.",313
1,"Unfortunately I had 16 of the 20 songs on other DVD's I own. I thought the selection of ""Greatest"" was far from the best. Moreover, the clarity of many of them were not up to the standard of the originals! Several were too dark, some of the colors were bad, and some were fuzzy. I might be a little prejudiced since I got only four new tunes, and if another similar album is produced it must have the contents available before purchasing. Surely I would not have bought it if I had known the selections.",503
1,IN MY OPINION --Over the past year or so: too many of my Duracel batteries have leaked. One took the stain finish off my wooden table top (shape of the battery). Another ruined a TV controller and several others leaked and required the controllers to be meticuously cleaned before they were again operational.,309
1,"I have an answer to the question now of what is the worst book I have ever read. This book takes the cake hands down. Take away the glossy pictures and you are left with a cold, frozen, solid turd hidden under a layer of snow. Coincidently, that is also its value...",266
1,This product came in damaged it even looked like it had been used and reboxed. The handle was all torn up and it was low on hydraulic fluid. I will not ever buy from this company again.,185
1,this was the worst service i have ever had from this sight i always order all sorts of things and never have i had a problem untill i tryed to order a movie for my 6 month old daughter she loves the lion king and i wanted to get her the only one she was missing which of course was lion king one and a half but inside the movie was lion king two. everything on the cover and disk looked liek it was supposed to be for that movie but when i played it it was the worng movie i am very upset about this,499
1,"Why oh why must a secret agent or assassin go through so many places and tense meetings just to carry out one assignment? I usually admire Jim Jarmusch films for their style and pace, but the drugs have finally destroyed his mind and taste to discern an interesting story from a thin one. It's packed with pseudo intellectual crap about the meaninglessness of life that's just amateurish.",388

However, the wire cage part just sits on top of the base, theres no way to actually connect it.

1,"Very disappointed, the only song that I wanted ""You Turn me On"" wasn't on the CD. Went back and looked and it was listed as one of the songs with a disclaimer. why even list it as a track, if its not on the disk???",214
1,"Bad acting bad editing, and only the most superficial points of the story were played out. The older BBC version was worthy though low budget.",142
1,It was too expensive and a waste of my hard earned money. I wish it would have had bigger holes for the ta ta's. And it's not comfortable the way my chest and stomach rests on it. I will never use it. But that is just me. I had a nice pillow for the ta ta's years ago but my puppy chewed it up. Darn it! It had big holes and didn't fit but under the chest. So comfortable. But i can't find it out there anywhere.It looks to be well made and would last years and years if this is what you are looking for.,504
1,"This phone has the ability, when more than a few messages are left, to make everyone sound like they are calling from the last day of a three day binge on spring break. Really! I dont know how it does this when it is tapeless, perhaps its some sort of plot to make us question our sanity. not a great phone!!",308

1,Ho hum. This book is highly overrated in my opinion. Tell me something I didn't already know. THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE and DONT SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF IN LOVE are far more insightful and useful.,189
1,"First let me say that I only gave this remote 1 star because that was the lowest allowable rating.That being said, do not, I repeat, do not buy this. I am extremely unhappy with this product. Not only does my controller NOT work while the remote sensor is plugged in (a big reason why I bought it), two of the buttons (the stop button & the confirm button) are misconfiguired.I had read that all of the current models being shipped had this error fixed. Apparently not.Save your money.",485
1,"In summary: This is a book about an extremely selfish woman who then proceeds to inflict long-term damage on the men who have the misfortune to love her and expect her to behave like an adult. Then she gets to write a book about it and make lots of money. I just cannot have any sympathy for Ms. ""woe-is-me"" Gilbert. I felt more for the men she steamrolled over in her ""quest.""",377
1,"As a spot check, I tried to look up several of the weeds in my yard. I couldn't find ""creeping charlie"" or ""birdfoot trefoil"", which are quite common around here. The ""common plantain"" in my yard looks nothing like the plantain illustration in the book.",253
1,I returned this the very next day. This item is too bulky/cumbersome and the material is not comfortable at all.,112
1,"I had a Panasonic breadmaker for years and used a popular breadmaker cookbook with it. When I got my new breadman I tried the same recipes and they didn't work. I make only really whole grain breads and they turn out dry and lumpy in the Breadman. My mother-in-law had the same problem with Breadman and now has a Zohirushi. My observations are 1) multigrain rise times must be programmed manually, 2) the Breadman lets the dough get drier than other breadmakers, and 3) the rise cycle is not heated which decreases the lift in heavy breads.",541
1,"I bought this book because I love fantacy novels. Although, the stories are well written and classics. The book reminded me of assigned literature from english class, a bit dry. I did find a couple of stories cute, but not great. This book is easy to put down. If you wish to know the evolution of fanticy novels then you would enjoy this book.",344
1,"the material was awful, felt like plastic and my son hated them, couldn't return these jeans fast enough and replace them with a better pair",140
1,"Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought ""Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man"". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least.",469
1,"I've watched, and loved James Bond movies for many years now. Hell, I've even read the books by Ian Fleming which are better than the movies that are loosely based on. But this is the worst Bond picture ever made! It has too much computor animation and sci-fi moments. I wouldn't recommened anyone to watch this movie, let alone buy it!",336
1,"I'ts rare that I submit a review, but I felt I must express my disappointment in this overpriced DVD, there was only 20-30 seconds of live concert footage from just a select handfull of Dio era Rainbow songs (this DVD was not done with band approval) basiclly it's a bunch of overly zealous fans giving their opinions on how great a guitarist Ritchie Blackmore is, in the end, I neither saw or learned anything new from this DVD that I didn't already know.I can only wish that someday the complete Rainbow 1977 concert will be released on DVD.",543
1,"The main reason I purchased this movie was because it starred Robert Pattinson. He did a good job in his role in the account. But, although it may have been true story, the movie was done in a poor way, in my opinion. I did not really care for the movie.",254
1,"I have this CD and these are not the original charted hits and sound. I am disappointed with it. If you, too, like the original sound, don't purchase this one. I purchased this CD from a record club thru the mail and was led to believe these were the original CHARTED hits. They are not. It's the original artist, the original songs, but not the original charted versions of them!",380

1,"I ordered this product based on the description that it was 'indestructible' for even the strongest of chewers. My dog took all of 5 minutes to destroy it (he tore big chunks off and tried to eat them). I know that my dog is a particularly focused chewer, but this toy should never have been described as indestructible. Having said that, they were true to their promise of a complete refund.",392
1,My title says it all. I should have looked at the item description more carefully. Essentially it is a 1 foot long plastic stick with a 3 foot long knit string attached. You are supposed to wave it in front of your cat. It takes two to use this (you and your cat). I got bored with it after a few minutes and left it to the cat to play with. He also got bored with it when his manservant gave up on waving it about. Any 3 foot long strip of terrycloth will do the same for well under a buck.Cat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy,537
1,I have read many of Anne Perry's books and enjoyed all of them until I read this mess. The characters are boring and the story is also. I got half way through it and decided it wasn't going to improve. I am sorry for readers who bought it and couldn't return it to the library! In a word I would describe it BOOOOORRRRRRIIINNNG!,328
1,"I know there are many people who've posted excellent reviews of this product, and that's what I based my decision to purchase on. However, I have a fairly small yard and no matter where I placed the bug zapper, we were still swarmed by mosquitoes.

1,"THIS BOOK WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME. IT HAD NO PLOT, NO READABLE DIALOGUE, NO POINT AT ALL, CRUDE, LEFT THIS READER WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CONCERN ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER AT ALL.

1,"This has to be the most narcissistic book I have ever read. Another reviewer described it as self-indulgent, and I agree. I started reading this with the best of intentions, but then found myself skipping parts in the hope I would find something relevant and/or meaningful.

1,This item is misrepresented in the description. It comes with a strap that cannot be attached without buying and installing an end pin and it says it comes with a pitch pipe which was not included.

As long as the arms race was waged on a purely quantitative basis, the Soviets could hang in the game. Once the equation became both Quality AND quantity, the game was soon over.

(Neither my husband or I are over weight so that was not the issue) I really had great hopes for this chair because our new baby girl really seemed to like it and it was pretty comfortable but I am not happy that the chair lasted less than 30 days. If I had purchased it locally I would have returned the chair or at least gotten a replacement.,507

Even favorites that could've saved this set (like usually-amazing ""Ill Parole Negra"") come off weak. And Mercury's vocals here (again, save the studio track) sound overworked and, at times, (dare I say) half-assed.

1,The nudity and general smut in this movie was very unnecessary. It ruined the entire movie. It could have been a decent movie had they not thrown sexuality into it. Plus this movie isn't scary at all. The witch was a very likeable character and the little pumpkin man on the front is actually very cute so it's hard to see him as an evil being when he is so adorable. There are better movies out there to watch on Halloween.,424

All of the political drama aside, the songs I heard were nothing more than contemporary pop country garbage.

The ram is poorly designed; it hits the cans at an angle and pushes the can sideways a lot of the time. I have wound up having to hold the can in place to et it to crush. The pin that holds the handle and ram to the wall part has nothing to hold it in place and worked its way out the first time I used it. The hopper is a joke. The only ""good"" thing was the cheap price. I should have paid more.",549
1,"Although Justin Guarini has a ""Nice"" voice...this album was just a total miss. The R&B ballads and duet with Kelly Clarkson are the only things that make this album even worthy of music store shelves. The lyrics are mediocre and cheesy, and the vocal arrangement of the songs are sloppy and unprofessional. Not only is this album a critical failure, but it's failed to woe the so-called fans of Justin Guarini, considering it has been a commercial flop along with the co-released movie. Don't waste your time or your money.",523

Also, some of the instructions are not clear about which end of the diagram should be facing up. This book could be written a lot better!",446

1,"I was so excited to use this product because of the great reviews and it just seemed like a very functional gadget. When my daughter was born, I only used it to check the time. I recorded everything by pen and paper - the last time she ate, slept, pooped, etc. for myself as a reminder and to report to my pediatrician her activities. Plus, my baby told me when it was time to feed, when she pooped, when it's time to sleep again, etc... This item is useless.",459

1,I absolutely loved the first 100 pages of this novel. But all too soon it starts to sink under the weight of its near-hysteria melodrama. The loves scenes are overwritten and the dialogue too arch--people don't talk like this. Hrbek needed to pare down on the purple prose in order to have saved this one.,305

1,"This book has nothing good to offer a student of philosophy. The only exception may be a sense of how not to do philosophy. Reiman, in several chapters ""responds"" to various attacks on western liberalism. In each of these, instead of outlining the actual arguements against liberalism, he changes them into something else and ""refutes"" them thus. In logic it's called a straw man. By anyone's definition, this is bad philosophy. Furthermore, he has a very poor understanding of many philosophers he uses in this book. Really just and awful book.",545

1,"I really don't get it. High reviews and best-seller for weeks in a row. This is a movie for adults to relieve their frustration for not having experienced life at it's best when they had a chance to. Any teen-ager should look at it with despise and a grin in the face, for they know better. Not much of a comedy, the gags just barely make it. Or maybe it's just the fact that I am not American and missed it all together...Certainly not worth even the ticket for the theater, let alone the DVD price.",500

She's still crying as I write this and after watching the first ten minutes to see what the deal is, I turned it off (racial epithets, drugs, probation and prison all in that short time). Note to self and others, just because it comes with Benji don't assume it is OK for children.",411

Like as soon as she heard a rider that showed alot was coming to Pine Hollow she immeadiatley went nuts, that's not at all normal.

1,"This book is a fine example of beautifully written, highly descriptive prose. Unfortunately, it serves only to demonstrate the overall importance of story over style. One keeps waiting for the story line to pick up, and occasionally some vague hint promises that it might. It never does, then one begins to hope that the ending might justify all the labor invested in the bland reading. The end resolves nothing; it is neither unique nor even interesting, leaving the reader wondering how he or she got duped into staying with such a long, lifeless narrative.",559

Cena has been in nearly every WWE main event for almost over two years now. I put down the dvd and didnt even buy it. Seven matches? Really thats a TNA dvd.",493

1,"After reading the positive reviews on this book, I was so looking forward to reading it. I could not have been more disappointed. The book is simply not the fun and humorous book I was expecting. It is boring and not very funny. Many of the insights about Christmas in the south are accurate but they are not presented in way that is entertaining. It's a great idea for a fun book but this one just doesn't work.",412

However, for some reason, the USB connector requires inserting and removing from the computer USB connector in order for computer to recognize the Sabrent USB-2535. It is a little frustrating, but it permits me to be able to use the several HDDs that I have collected from old computers without spending too much money for individual external HDD cases.",388
1,"Have you ever gotten that embarrassed feeling for someone? Y'know, you just want to cringe and make it stop. Well, that's the way I felt about this book. Jon Stewart, who is funny on T.V., is painfully unfunny in print. This book was a chore to read. I felt so bad for Mr. Stewart because he so clearly embarrasses himself with this book. I wish his editor would've stepped in and protected him from doing this. Stick to T.V., Mr. Stewart, you're no Mark Twain. Yikes!",468

1,"I second all of the previous negative comments about this pitiful excuse for a sequel to HALO. I knew the game would never live up to all of the hype but never in my wildest dreams did I think it would suck this bad. Maybe the multiplayer makes some people happy but I loved the original HALO for the storyline and intense level play in the campaign. All of that is gone in HALO 2. Might as well have thrown $50 out of the window. Run from this game, run very far away...",471

1,I agree. The book starts off with dcpromo.exe and then moves onto driver signing. Looks like a tornado hit this layout. It is difficult to follow and nothing builds to anything. They talk about mmc in the early chapters and then go into detail later.Avoid!!Get the MCSE Win 2k acclerated Training kit from Microsoft Press. You can get them for [price]dollars like I did from the used book section.(saved [price]... thanks amazon!!),431

1,"It's dawson creek meeting scary movie. I was wondering if this movie was a horror or a comedy. The acting is so bad, the killer is laughable in his/her disguisement.The dialogue is ridiculous.My opinion is : it's not derisive enough to be a great comedy and not serious enough to make you scared ! So what is it ? It's like the director wanted to make a comedy but his sense of humour wasn't good enough.Also it's so predictible. I knew who was the killer as soon as all the characters have been introduced (there is not enough possibilities indeed).SKIP THIS ONE !",565
1,Save your money. This toy never worked from day 1. The microphone worked but the CD player didn't. We sent it back and a new one came and that one also wouldn't play a CD. I'm surprised the quality control is so poor. Apparently others agree with me. I should have read all the reviews first!,292

1,"""In the vein of high school musical"" was what the description said, so I thought I knew what I was getting. I was wrong. Words cannot express my dislike of this film. Even a musical needs a coherent plot of some kind, but IKaV had none. The music was mediocre at best, the villain not really villainous, and the production value felt just one step higher than what some friends would do in their garage. The vocal talent wasn't too far off though. Still, save your money, save your time, and save yourselves.",508
1,"I bought this DVD because of all the great reviews I saw. After watching it, I don't get what people liked about it. If you've ever taken a Pilates class, this DVD is about 100 times easier. When I saw the title I thought it meant it would help you with your flexibility. After watching it, I think they meant that if your inflexible, buy this DVD because you won't have to move much. Through most of the video, she's barely moving! It may be good if your very old or injured, otherwise, I would recommend either a Pilates class or a different DVD.",548
1,"Personally I thought this was a boring film with phoned-in performances by both Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, and what little plot there was had no suspense or mystery or charm whatever and the entire project lacked the style usually found in Richard Curtis' work. Even a strong supporting cast that included Gina McKee was not much of a boost. I usually go for these sorts of movies but this is one Britcom (very little ""com"" to it, by the way) I didn't enjoy.",461

No gold filter included. I have bought other electronic equipment in the past that was referb and most arrived in excellent condition. I would say that the referb company has no QC controls before sending units back into the field. Bottom line watch for discounts and purchase new. (may try as a boat anchor),491
1,"I enjoyed High Energy, and thought that I would enjoy this book as well. However, I felt the author worked too hard to tie this book to the previous one. I would rather reach the conculsion that Tyber is pirate-like by seeing him in action, than having it pointed out to me every couple pages. This book was very sensual, a plus, however the sensuality was the main focus of the book and the story line/mystery was a distant second. If that is what you are looking for, you will probably enjoy this book.",504

1,"This book started out slowly, got slower & slower, and then finally picked up its pace at the end. You know it's not the greatest book in the world when a golf enthusiast such as I can manage to read a chapter & then set it aside for a week at a time. It does have some charming character development, however, and I thought the stories at the end of the book bumped this book up from an otherwise deserving one-star book.",422

1,I purchased this DVD twice and it was not the Godfrey Ho classic with Richard Harrison. It is Ninja City (Tou qing ke 1985) directed by Yeung Chuen Bong starring Wai-Man Chan and Martin Lee. Both movies were known as Ninja Holocaust and this may be what lead to the error. It is a shame because I was looking forward to receiving the Richard Harrison movie as stated in the product information. PLEASE FIX THIS!,411
1,"I always thought I knew what the F-word meant until I saw this movie. It now has the meaning of a truly wasted 3 hours, maybe even more since I had to drive there and back. Both actors and writers have a great deal of talent, it was just wasted on the F-word movie.",265

But I was intensely disappointed when, after installing it on both a Dell and an Imac, with one single successful ""test page"" printout, it refused to work on either.

Every time I saw this term being used, I was jarred out of the time being described and into current terms and political correctness.",478

By the time it reaches Wisconsin the entire shipment is already environmentally exposed causing the gum to be sticky and unusable in vending machines.

After trying to find some sort of lesson amid the busy garrish pictures, and finding none, we decided we had better books to read. It is appearantly a story about punctuation marks that go on vacation with no lessons to teach whatsoever, though the claim is that you learn the punctuation's function from its personality in their postcards to the classroom. I beg to differ. Vague- AT BEST. We love learning from stories. We hated this book.",560
1,"What a waste of time! This book is poorly written, redundant in the extreme, badly (if at all) edited, and replete with Sheehy's liberal bias.

The lavish sets themselves do not create a real presence for me as much as they seem dressed up and rather silly. Ms. Kloster has some other work I would recommend before this.",486

1,"This band sucks. My roommate will not stop playing this album. All of the songs sound exactly the same, but have completely unnecessary and random bridges. The canned techno in the middle of track two almost made me barf. The lyrics make no sense at all. Awful awful album.",273
1,More a book of trivia and biography of guitar legends. This would not be a good investment for those wanting to learn and understand how to play guitar. Its OK for those who just want an overview of guitars and the history of. It doesnt go into any depth of theory. Dont expect to become a better guitar player if you buy this book.,332
1,"I really wanted to like this album, I really did. I love ""Come Clean"" and I was in anticipation of this, but when I got it I couldn't believe how bland and uncreative it was. It sounds like it was thrown together in ten minutes. The only reason i give it two stars is for the songs ""Away From Me"" and ""Sydney"" that's it. The rest of this CD is awful. This band can do much better than this. I am, however still a fan, I just the hope the next album (If there ever is one) shows me a little more.",495

I am trashing mine so I could never hear it again. Awful, awful CD.",365

1,"I bought these and they promply broke. The Batteries are suppose to charge and be interchangeable, but it seemed one battery never worked and eventually the other one quit (less than two months) as well. The battery connection was not well thought out. I bought a set of Plantronics P500 and have been quite pleased with them. I will not buy any more Blue Ants",360
1,The product I received was of the finest quality. It came in a timely manner and I was able to review the material prior to class start. The book was packaged in a manner that would prevent any damage thru the mail and came in excellent condition. I was extremely satisfied with this book and the quickness of the receipt of the order. Thank you!,346

1,"I couldn't suffer through more than 64 pages of Tami Hoag's ""Still Waters."" Talk about misleading covers and ""blurbs."" A Harlequin Romance-type cover would realistically reflect the contents of the book and saved me $5.25. The dialogue is adolescent, the characters are weak, ineffectual and irritatingly boring (do adult women still ""roll their eyes""?) I was so disgusted with the characterizaton that I paid little attention to the plot. There was one, wasn't there?This was my first and last Tami Hoag book!",510
1,I can't believe this movie has a 3 1/2 star rating on amazon. This is a typical boring story naration bombarded in Indian cinema. I wonder if any of the makers have relationship with Indian filmies. Even the music played several times is Indian movie music.A waste of time. Enjoy quality family time instead of watching this boring badly made movie.,349
1,"This tape skipped, when being recorded on, as they are no longer making this tape, and it was very old, having probably sat on the shelf for who-knows-how-long!! Once they stopped making VCRs, it seems they stopped manufacturing tape for them, and are now trying to sell off old stock! Since there is no ""expiration date"" on the box, you have no way of knowing how old it is, but the recording results do not lie . . . you get bad recordings that are not watchable!!",466

1,"The good part of the book was the fact that it came with a cd-rom. The bad part was that it was very hard to understand, even when the professor tried to explain the concepts behind what the authors were saying. Budgeting was the toughest chapter to understand because it seemed like each of the 10 concepts in that chapter weren't explained enough for me nor any of my classmates to understand.",395

1,"What a disappointment! I read and believed the rave reviews, then I read this novel and felt horribly cheated. See just doesn't know how to effectively tell a dramatic story. The characters are so broad and synthetically drawn that - where's the interest. The ingredients are all here, but the book just caves in like a half-baked cake. In fact, ""half-baked"" is the adjective that perfectly describes this unfortunate attempt at fiction.",437

1,"My family has loved all the history ""news"" books in this series. They are witty, clever and full of excellent information on the period they cover.Sadly, this book is nothing like the others. It isn't witty and clever but didactic, heavy handed and preachy in the way of a dull textbook. It really shouldn't be sold as part of this series.",339
1,This book boasted that it was for everyone from beginner to advanced. I found this to be completely untrue. I have a limited knowledge of html and was totally unimpressed. The CD also claims to have hundreds of templates. I found the templates boring.,251
1,"I could not finish this book. Shannon Drake does have some good books but I found nothing believable about this book. The hero and heroine are totally cookie cutter characters. Really, the heroine is bar/brothel owner by day and patrols for crime by night. Yet, she is pure and virginal. I just had to laugh.",308

And yes we have been on the Do-Not-Call registry since it first came out.We continue to get a half dozen junk call a day and have had the Tele-Zapper for about three weeks.It may have worked on a few that we are not aware of (Is that you that's not calling when the phone doesn't ring?); but it does not seem like it.We suspect that the junk callers have figured out how to circumvent the Tele-Zapper's functions - but have no way to confirm this.,526
1,You think Amazon would check on this before they match up the products. I like the MP3 player. Wish it came with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable to plug into my car.,156
1,"There is not one single pleasure to be found in this novel. The story could have been much better. It had wonderful potential--Florence, the world of antiquities, an intriguing and rare discovery. But the main character--the supposed heroine--was painfully insipid. Whiny and self-absorbed from start to finish, the protaganist was an embarrassing caricature of an American woman living abroad.",394
1,"The case is good in that it fits my laptop. . .but there is ZERO room for the mouse, charger, or even a piece of paper for that matter. Well, maybe for a piece of paper, but that's it. The price was fair (on sale in the gold box) for what I got, though, or else it would be going back.",285
1,"I am disappointed with this item. It was inexpensive, but of very low quality. I was very frustrated when trying to assemble the rack. There were no instructions and the shelves wouldn't stay put. Without any cans on it, it just kept popping apart. It is also not as roomy as I'd expected, but it really depends on the size of the cans that you are trying to store.",365
1,I don't care for this flea comb. It is ok to use as a regular comb for a short haired dog. I have a regular small tooth metal one that I purchased from vet and it works. This one doesn't.

1,"It's hard to believe the author of the Alex Cross novels has sunk this low.Most of the plot twists are telegraphed well in advance. But the worse problem is that this book is poorly written. Characters frequently mouth the obvious (in case you missed it), and if that is not enough, there is a movie-style ""epilogue"" with a gratuitous attack scene, presumably so that the reader can feel good about killing off a particular character. Just dreadful: poor writing, cliché after cliché in the characters, a hokey plot. Shame on you, James Patterson.",547
1,"This book is dry and unenjoyable and has zero practical advice. It is poorly written and basically is the same concept repeated over and over. I don't think it will help make the wait easier, after reading this, you will probably be more desperate than ever to find your ""someone."" For a really good book on singleness, I would recommend ""Sacred Singleness"" by Leslie Ludy.",373

I don't like this front mounted design at all.I should mention that my child loves it - riding up front with a steering wheel. But it's just too unsafe for me to ride.",529

Every story in that book grabs you and takes you to the Africa you dream of... This film bring you back to earth and shows you what every hunter already knows ...

1,All those claims of improved reception are a joke. I plunked down over 20 dollars for a splitter that worked exactly like my 2.99 splitter. I guess I should have just taken it off and returned it but you all know what a pain that is. I'll have to chalk it up to experience.Bottom line: Don't believe everything you read. It's probably all just one scheme and sale pitch.,370

1,So disappointed. Found something similar by Matchbox and went with this. What a mistake. pieces don't stay together. reassembling to put back in carrying case is impossible. you have to have your own vehicles to place with this toy which is deceiving in the packaging. This was nothing but disappointment each time we pulled it out. I have thrown it away and my 5 year hasn't missed it.,386
1,"I took this out to use, and first of all could barely figure out how to change the settings... but the battery showed it was low when i turned it on the first time. I couldn't find a replacement anywhere... so I gave up. Shame, because it looked promising.",256

I tried setting it on my stock pot, but in spite of its small volume, it was too tall to fit over my medium-sized stock pot. Compared to other sieve and pestle sets I've used, this is inadequate, cheaply made, too small, and not worth the $40 price tag. I plan on taking it back to the store and exchanging it for something better, or even store credit; it's not a kitchen tool worth owning.",518

1,There was ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to buy this battery other than THIS WEBSITE promoted it to be needed in the long run for this toy. The battery that was delivered WAS NOT compatible with the product we bought and the return AND delivery was and is a nightmare. When Toys R Us was contacted they admitted that you did NOT need this EXTRA battery and MANY MANY times the battery shipped is NOT compatible with the toy. (...),420
1,"The spinbrush was average - it didn't do anything extra special. The massager kind of hurt on my forehead and chin and was not soothing anywhere else. However, the biggest disappointment was the pore cleaner. The suction did not do anything at all. It did not remove blackheads like it was supposed to. Save your money and buy a $4 facial exfoliator at the drugstore!!!",369
1,"I will confess that I TRIED to like Creed. I heard ""Higher"" on the radio many times, and TRIED to understand the lyrics and not grind me teeth as the guitar player tried to remove his fingers from between the strings.

Does Scott Stapp have something stuck in his mouth?",464

I chose this blade for its good reviews and it does so far perform well but even though it was sealed in a 24"" marked box, the actual blade is only 22.5"" long, which leaves a large, unwiped wedge between the two blades. So be warned, and check your sizing. I could've gotten the 26"" model and it would probably have been a better fit if they're all sized short.",543

I managed to get the wrench to work but quality of product is very poor.,372
1,Very few songs were performed that I recognized. Music was arcane and did not venture far from basic blues. The concert was a total disappointment. Could only be appreciated by die hard blues purists. In my humble opinion the buying the dvd was a waste of my money!,265

1,"When watching this film at the theater I almost walked out. It really seamed not to be a Star Trek film and certainly not one of the Star Trek The Next Generation films. Something there is missing, the now classic characters seemed bored and very boring. As with Generations I didn't care for the lighting which gives the Federation ship a very dark look. The film was promotted as the film with the vilian as good as Kahn, should be because he was a carbon copy. When are they going to just release a good story that doesn't have a vilian?",540

I checked 50 of the references she used to give ""facts"" in the book, and 49 of them were either wrong, misquoted, or downright lies. Unfortunately, the only conclusion I can come to is this is the type of ""writing"" that, while it appeals to the Jerry Springer-esque crowd, is dangerous and inciting. This book should be read as fiction, since most of it is simply made up.",557

The first cube that I received triped the GFI every time I plugged it in , I emailed amazon and they promptly sent another. I plugged it in and everything looked good but by then it had warmed up so it wouldn't trip on, so I waited.

The movie bears only a fleeting resemblance to the book and misses the point entirely. Aside from that, it was poorly done. I would click over and buy the book...you will be deeply disturbed by it. As for the movie, skip it!",349
1,am i the only who who notdid think it was that great. it was boring an slow movie at parts and predictable. there were a few good things about it thou mainly jamie lee curits returning and a pre peral harbor josh harnett. it also had refence to the orignal which was good. the biggest loose was that of donland plesance who played dr. loomis. he brought the series part of its life unfortualy he died a few years before this was made. too bad he would have brought the movie up a star.,485

1,I'm glad I borrowed this book and did not buy it. It is dirty and venal. Anti-Christian books are very popular with Jews and guaranteed excellent reviews.Carrol wrote this unscholarly work of hateful passion knowing he'd be loved by the New York Times and the Washington Post. I heard the smug and self-righteous interview that National Public Radio gave him. If you heard that interview - imagion 300 pages of it. That is what this book is about.,447
1,"Unfortunately, the option of zero stars was not available for this book. This is conservative reactivism at its worst. The author obviously misunderstood the purpose of a university education.

The automated support system on Symantec's website is hard to find answers and frustrating to navigate. The privacy monitor is a good concept, but a pain to work with, especially in email. The only thing I trust in this product to work is the virus scan utilities. Everything else is hit or miss depending on the day. I'm extremely disappointed with this software.",531

You'd think that when Disney put this series on dvd, that it would be on sale for 2-4 years or so. I know there is a profit in selling the box set. So why did Disney decided to sell the set for a limited of 30,000??? That makes no sense. The box set came out in Nov 09, and 3-4 months later it's already Out Of Print. Seems pointless to sell the series, and then discontinue it so short of time. Very disappointing.",524

I was surprised that it came with a floppy disk with the drivers on it---who even USES floppys anymore!? I was able to dl drivers off the website though, so that wasn't a big deal. My biggest disappointment with this mouse is the fact that it is SOOOOO jumpy! It skips ALL over the place, and that is REALLY annoying. For this ONE reason, a very big one (to me), I rate it at a 2.",491
1,I can't believe a product like this ever made it to market. This is simply a normal cat 5 or cat 6 STP (shielded twisted pair) cable. You can buy similar cables for $5-$10 at most. I can make my own for about $1...10 cents a foot for raw cable and 25 cents each for the end connectors. The quality will be exactly the same because a digital cable is a digital cable. Either you get the signal or you don't.,406
1,"For $23, you get two packages of curls. They run about $6.50 per package at my local grocery. When I complained, I was sent two more packages, so this was a better deal, but still not what I would expect from Amazon.

I will buy them locally from now on, or at least until Amazon gets a better listing and better price.",475

Eventually he tore too many to be able to use.",387

Yes, her acting is good, but the story itself is not; i actually found it to be very blah and wanted it to end soon after it started. I don't see how this is a psychological thriller... she's just messed up, nothing thrilling about that.

1,"This pamphlet states the obvious about health. It doesn't have much useful and is basically just to promote the products created by this doctor. To sum up the booklet, it says to see a kinesiologist and then use the author's products if you have Lyme. It also says avoid nutrasweet, msg, soda, smoking, alcohol, junk food. Drink water and deap breathe. That's about it. I just saved you 10 bucks.",396
1,"Very wide range of topics, but very little depth. I don't think this is really a book for the advanced programmer. There is only one measly chapter on ActionScripting, which is one of the most useful features of Flash 4. I didn't find it useful at all when it came to backend/Flash integration - you'd be better off trying something else.",338
1,"Someone else wrote ""Bleck"" in a review...I couldn't have said it better. For a book that both moved relatively quickly and generally kept my interest, I couldn't help but finish it a feel like having wasted my time. The first chapter alone is full of inconsistencies and then shortly thereafter the main ""hero"" gets ""innocent"" Caro into bed by getting her drunk. Great. I can't believe that I could actually like nearly all the characters except the main two. Even if steamy romance is your thing, this wasn't worth the read.",525
1,This song really shouldn't have been released as a single.It has very little appeal...the first one had more and it was enough to get her album launched.This song is one of those songs that make the album sales drop....Still go buy the album there are way way better songs....,276
1,"Anyone who pays money for this book gets as ripped off as the poor guy who wrote it. Slogging through this incredibly dull and trite blather, all I could think was how pathetic that this guy went through 6 years believing he was ""in analysis.""

1,"Maybe Higgins has a contract that needs to be completed. I read this book in one sitting - but not because it was a page turner. Well, it was a page turner because there were hardly any words on the page!This was a weak effort.

Sean Dillon is over the hill!",428

The mats slide around and make it difficult to get in and out. I should have bought husky liners like my husband has in his truck. They fit good and do not more, oh yah and they are alot cheaper. Knowing what I know now I would never buy these, so dont you make the same mistake.",440

Yes, they are full of sadistic acts, sex and cruelty and violence....and boring as hell. Everyone in this film is entranced and moved....even to action...by de Sade. Why? Why would we be?Boring stupid film that isn't really about anything. {as one reviewer points out it's supposed to be about freedom of speech and ideas, but then they can't even read real De Sade passages because they'd be censored! see...pointless!]",531

1,"If you like topless females jumping around, this collection rates a 5 star. The film makers really need to go to school or watch other films and see how to plot and write a action film using very pretty females to keep interest going.

The helmet itself had been used and had a 2-inches long crack on it. They had sent us a broken product that had been clearly marked as broken. This is unacceptable and highly degrading.",328
1,"This book made my blood boil. It distorts history, misstates the law, inaccurately critiques past court decisions in the field of habeas corpus and has an antidemocratic/antifederalism message that conflicts with the Constitution. Freedman's view of the Suspension Clause is contrary to fact and history. This type of expansive view of criminal justice would be more intellectually honest if it would call for the elimination of the states and the federalization of all criminal acts.",484

I couldn't believe the ""solution"" and kept waiting for the twist - where we find out what REALLY happened. Nope. It was just dumb.",375

1,I really tried with an open mind to like this show. After 3 episodes I just couldn't take it anymore! The only thing that made me watch 3 episodes was how hot the guy Niko was having an affair with. I just didn't find the characters likable. I felt like Victory was overly obsessive and just plain boring....,308

We are done with Melissa and Doug.",455
1,"This product was not worth the money. I could have purchased a better piece of medical equipment in a toy store. It was very light weight and did not give accurate readings, when it gave a reading. I tried to use this several times but was embarrassed because it either misread the BP or it read an outrageous pressure sure as 150/150. I eventually got frustrated with the device and returned it.",396
1,"This rather short coffee-table book is most notable for its collection of photos of Eleanor Roosevelt and her family. The photos are extensive, and a few have not been seen before by non-historians like myself. Otherwise, there was almost nothing new to be learned about this very remarkable and intelligent woman, much to my disappointment! Most amazing was that her grandson actually admitted that he was ignorant of her role on the public stage until her death when he was 20 years old!",489
1,The cook book was very disapointing. The only good thing about it was Andrew Weils tips that were scattered throughout the book. It should of been much better.,159
1,"This ranks as the worst movie/ boxed set I have ever owned. The story line is non existant, the photography is horrible (couldn't the director afford a tripod or a few extra lights?) and the main actress is so full of herself the movie went even further south than the rating scheme above is able to credit. Supporting characters are plastic imitations of the old horror movie disposable character; just before they get slashed; only they don't go away.I would send this to someone I don't like, but the Geneva Convention has made torture illegal.",547
1,"My 14# puppy had the ball all of 3 minutes when some of the outside peeled off. I managed to grab a piece of rubber the size of a quarter just before Nick swallowed it. He either would've crapped a UFO or I'd have been spending the night in the delightfully expensive and chaotic animal hospital. I looked at the outside of the ball and grabbed the side of the green plastic-- it peeled off easy. I know I'm a wrong girl, but if this is ""Tuff"" enough for powerful chewers, then i should probably be trying out for MMA.I'll be adding a few pics of what peeled off.",563

However, I caught a glimpse of the TTSG single, and I was totally disappointed at what I saw: three of the four songs (""Sleep Tight,"" ""You Take My Breath Away,"" and the intimate version of the song ""Time To Say Goodbye"") are all Sarah's recordings, even though she AND Andrea were featured on the front cover of the single together. For shame, Ms. Brightman, FOR SHAME!",555

1,"Those who scoop kitty litter know what happens when the slots are too big - much of what needs to be removed falls right back into the kitty litter. The overall size of the scoop is very small. It might work with clumping kitty litter, but I don't know because I don't use clumping kitty litter. The only good thing I can state about this scoop is that the plastic is recyclable, so it didn't end up in a landfill when I threw it out. Waste of money.",450
1,"I am somewhat disappointed in this product. It would probably be adequate for mild, general traffic noise screening. I need a more melodious, harmonious, deeper pitched screen, so perhaps my review is not relevant to this product; but its description did lead me to believe that it would work for my situation.",310
1,"This is a typical piece of Italian ""animal torture"" garbage! Please avoid purchasing this at all costs so that DVD companies will not reproduce this type of sadistic trash. This film demonstrates acts of animal cruelty that would make a Nazi grin with glee.",257

Really boring album as a result.",390
1,"Note that this version has been cut by 20 minutes (the full-length version is also available here on Amazon), i.e. there is no reason at all to be interested in this version unless, for reasons that can be known only to yourself, you have the truly wierd desire to see a Jess Franco movie with the squelchy bits cut out.",320

So Johnny and Sodapop runaway so the police does not find them. And at the end of the story Johnny dies.",492
1,"I love the Woods. The illustrations here are beautiful as ever; if a little subtle (unlike some other titles of theirs). They are also a little monotonous since almost the entire book takes place in the same room, same colors, same details with just one extra character subtly introduced on each page. My 22 month old is not impressed - maybe he's too young for this one. He LOVES 'Quick as a Cricket' and 'The Alphabet Adventure'.",431
1,"This version is dsappointing for two reasons:a) The image quality is very poorb) Rhere are no language options - this version of an originally Dutch film is provided with an American-English soundtrack only (highly incongruous, given that it's set in Amsterdam).Anyone looking for the Dutch original ""Grijpstra & De Gier"" should search elsewhere.",346

1,"I am a huge fan of New Orleans and Southern Literature, so when I saw this title, I was really excited. Sadly, Lois reminds me of Steinbeck, in that she has a great story to tell, and does a horrible job of telling it. Too bad, it could have been a wonderful read.",264
1,"My daughter and I love to study about animals together but we find this cd a little boring. However, it will come in handy for looking up specific information about birds ,for school projects, or home study. It is worth $[money].",229
1,This movie was simply aggravating to watch.There was never any sympathy for the characters and in fact Moores character was simply irritating.As for the supposed surprise ending.... WHAT SURPRISE ?The whole storyline is clearly laid out in the first 10 minutes.... after that we sit thru an exaggerated backdrop of a ghetto racial tension and endless rambling from Moore's character jsut waiting for the end to some that we know is coming anyway.,446
1,"The entire purpose of this movie is to highlight to children (and the child-like) ""Humans bad, animals good."" The ideology that humans are the scourge of the planet saturates this movie.It goes way overboard on anthropomorphism and shows humans with few redeeming qualities.I am horrified that I actually spent money on this propaganda.",336

Many great reviews and just as many bad ones. So there is no consistency in quality. Return shipping cost is not worth the hassle.",429

1,"Unlike the other reviews, this is the first book we've seen of this series. The author tries to be cute by giving the pigeon phoney city attitude which turns out to be neither fun for kids or adults. The premise is promising, a bird that loves vehicles, but there's little that shows an appreciation for the forms of transportation. And given its length this is one of the saddest buys for kids of that age group. Having heard the hype about the other books of this series I expected much more. Skip this royal stinker.",519

The cast is completely lost in a series of scenes that made no sense at all (like the shooting in a cave when Joshua killed the last outlaw.

Some of the time it did that but the hours would never respond when I hit 'mode'. I worked with it a long time and then finally returned it.,317
1,"I would have given ""Speaking of Now"" a '1', but some people may be new to Pat Metheny. He's too good to ever deserve the lowest score.This release is painfully uncreative. Each of the songs could safely be camouflaged on any one of his previous works with the Metheny Group.If you don't have them yet, try ""First Circle"" or ""Still Life (Talking)"".",347

1,"This trunk is unsatisfactory for shipping as checked baggage on an airline. First the catches will not keep it closed - I had to use a strap to keep all contents from being dumped everywhere. Second, it's oversize and I had to pay $49 extra (over and above the normal checked bag fee) to have it shipped. It's dimensions are 68.5 inches exceeding the 62 inch limit for checked baggage. I do not recommend this box for shipping on an airline. Definitely an inferior product. I'm sorry I bought the two I did.",507

1,I found the shoes too heavy for tennis. The cover over the laces made it difficult to pull the laces tight. I cut off the cover and that made it better. The advertisement on the back of one of the shoes came off which wasn't a functional part of the shoe so it didn't matter. The strip is still on the other shoe. I wouldn't buy this shoe style again. I bought it through Amazon and had not tried it on before purchase. Barbara Reynolds,436

1,I was not so impressed with this movie that I didn't even finish it. I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,112
1,This product made the picture way more blurry than the original composite video wire. Then it completely stopped working altogether. Its intended use was for a Epson Moviemate LCD projector. Will continue to use just the composite videowire only as it puts out an adaquate picture.,281
1,"Wanted to hear the impeccable Kiri te Kanawa, but found the music of Richard Strauss to be far less than awesome. I can only presume that I have nothing in common with Adolph Hitler, who thought that Strauss was the epitome of art.",231

1,"Very narrow, so much so that the picture is misleading with it showing it can hold regular shampoo bottles. It has to be a small shampoo bottle. Check the width measurement before buying to make sure it will work for you. I returned them.",238
1,Anyone who'd have a real live suicide to promote a CD has to suck. The only way they get people to hear them is by breaking laws and killing people. I agree with the Thai guy's review from above.,195
1,"The Prize was yet another Ashleigh book that had a shallow, uninteresting, and just plain stupid plot line. Since when was Ashleigh ever interested in eventing? This series is so untrue to the TB Super Edition Ashleigh's Diary, as are all the books not by Joanna Campbell. I say read the books by Joanna and forget all the others, but I'm addicted and forced to buy and read every one.",385

1,"The stories are continuous on these CDs - you cannot skip from one fairy tale to the next. When you push the skip button, it just fast forwards. Every time you play the CD, it starts at the beginning. So, to get to a different story, you have to keep searching and searching. Very difficult to find the beginning of the fairy tales. Much more trouble than it's worth!!!",369
1,I sometimes wonder what drug editors are on when they accept some novels. I'm afraid Monstrum is a perfect case of incomprehensible editorial decisions. Coincidence piles on coincidence as the hapless police inspector stumbles (litterally) on the solution to the crime. The ending leaves one totally exaspetated. One can only assume that the author's rush to justice was occasioned by his desire to reduce the reader's pain.,424
1,"Just rent the Hitchcock movie, because this is a disappointing version of this classic tale. The actors are bland, the sets are cheap, the intrigue is almost nonexistent.",170
1,"I was disappointed that I purchased an Amazon Prime membership to use the free lending library only to discover that it does not include the Kindle ap for iPad. I just spent $79 for Amazon Prime and one of the benefits is not available for my device. I think this should be more plainly stated. I wonder what other ""benefits"" will not work because I do not own a Kindle.",370
1,"I was glad to read that other reviewers were disappointed by this book. I was impressed that the author has a degree in literature from Harvard University, and was looking forward to some really good writing. What I found instead were extremely weak characters, an unrealistic plot premise, and sex scenes that were graphic enough to distract from the story, yet seemed to contain no emotion. I would not call this book a romance. I bought the paperback in a bookstore, and I am really wishing I could have the 6.99 back to spend on a different book!",550
1,My experience was totally different from the others listed here. I found the kit impossible to assemble--parts didn't fit together and the instructions were incomprehensible. This has to be the worst purchase I ever made from Amazon. A total waste.,248
1,"As this item was sold by Amazon, I trusted it was a genuine Garmin product (just like the product photo), however when I received it, I realized it was a generic charger with Garmin printed on it (very poorly)... 2 stars just because it works, however I don't know if it will compromise the durability of my Garmin GPS as it is not a genuine Garmin charger.",357

1,"Moved really slow & the author was more concerned with sex than plotting a good story. Very disappointed, was more like a bunch of stories from PlayBoy with a silly who dunnit stuck in between!

1,"Used this (or tried to...) to install an additional table in my RV. As stated in another review, the hinge points are really sloppy (especially the top one). The only option is to drill out the existing pin & replace it with something tighter otherwise the table sways like it's in a roller derby. I bought this because of the ""quick release"" which is nice -- just not nice enough to offset the sloppy workmanship...",416
1,"This book should be retitled ""Understanding the Borderline Mother: Helping Her DAUGHTERS Transcend the Intense, Unpredictable, and Volatile Relationship"". The author passes on sons feeling they will end up in prison or narsistic and marrying someone like their mother to continue the cycle. It was a real let down and after reading the introduction I dind not continue the book.",378
1,"I ordered this bracelet weeks ago, still haven't received it. Not what I was expecting since another reviewer stated that the seller had fast shipping. I have arthritis and will be trying it out for joint pain. I cant comment on the quality of it since its still floating around somewhere, but I will certainly when/if I ever recieve it. UPDATE-once I received this, it was gorgeous. It seems my local post office lost the package. It's a little small and sometimes leaves marks on my arm but i think with wear it will loosen up",528
1,"I have owned ""The X Files"" the movie for years on LaserDisc and have enjoyed watching the movie many times over the years. I was hoping that this movie could live up to the original but was very disappointed to discover that it was in no way equal and actually fell short by a wide margin.The movie falls victim to entirely too many clichés and winds up a rather pathetic horror flick. I will not watch it again and caution any fan of X-Files to proceed with great caution.",473
1,"The jokes in this book are not only unfunny, they are not worthy of actually being called jokes. I have flipped through many of the pages in search of a good laugh and haven't found anything remotely close. I rarely post reviews. Out of curiosity I looked up this book on Amazon and saw someone posted 5 stars.This person is clinically insane.I am _that_ driven to post just to bring the average rating down. You will get more laughs with your seven dollars by renting Les Miserables.",484
1,"Yes, I found a beetle larvae in our formula! Do NOT buy this product. I called the company, they are aware of the issue and are refunding the money but that doesn't take care of the problem. I switched to Enfamel enfacare. DO NOT BUY NEOSURE, PLEASE!!",251
1,"This is easily the worst of the Lethal Weapon series. By this point, the interplay between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is annoying. Joe Pesci is irritating, not funny. The script and characters are politically correct, and not realistic. Finally, the language would make a sailor blush. The only redeeming feature is the bad guy.",329

1,Bought this for my teenage son who has experience with airsoft guns. Needless to say the gun broke within a few months. The gun didn't even get to participate in a airsoft contest. It stopped shooting and battery gets extremely hot just from very light use. Save your money and purchase a real airsoft gun from places like e-vike.com or the like. A few more dollars will buy you a superior gun.,394

There are plenty of other options. No more Polder products for me.",447
1,"I am a big fan of Leap Frog products- we have many. I was surprised and disappointed to find that this does not live up to the company's reputation. The pad is hard to activate.

Even though this product is not a good one, the company makes many other great products.",403

1,The VCR on mine broke after I used it once (it now chews up tapes). I was past the meager warranty period and it would cost almost more than I paid for the thing to have it repaired. So I'm not a fan.,200
1,Thankfully I only paid [money] for this cd single. The original edit is the only decent version on the cd and that only goes for 4 minutes. Why do they pay dj's to remix these songs when the remixes are awful and the original in infinitely better. I think dj's have stopped trying and just put out any rubbish for cd fillers. My advice would be don't buy this until you have listened to it first.,396
1,"product highly NOT recommended. all i could taste was the sulfur dioxide. my daughter took a case to school for a party pass out, they all ended up in the trash can. it was quite the let down for her. i'm sure if they left out the sulfur dioxide and replaced it with lemon juice or a citric acid this product would become a top seller.",335
1,"I now understand why there is only one review of this book, and from the authors friend. This book is not about anything but the author. This author has attempted to put Paul Bernardo in poetry form...GIVE ME A BREAK! There are some sick word games and even sicker pencil drawn pictures.

1,"Wow... my money would have been better spent buying Teen Beet magazine. This ""book"" is nothing more than a recycled diary from a drug addled girl in her teens and twenties, living through her rock idols' fantasies. My guess is they are more her fantasies than theirs. The only thing I learned from her ""writing"", is that she seems pretty self-involved. Nothing new here about some of my favorite artists from the era, only old stories told with Miss P's name added. Do yourselves a favor, and pass on this one. If you feel you have to read it, borrow it!",554

1,"The warm up was about the most useful exercise on this tape. Besides the horrendous pronunciations (including ballet terms), my daughter learned more from the Barbie Nutcracker. If only I had it to do again... :(",212
1,The writers style needs refining. It reminded me of a cross between The Outermost House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This is not a combination that works. My love for Cape Cod forces me to speak out against this book. The author obviously has some maturing to do. Not only in his stlye of writing but in the discovery of his environment.,342
1,I have had three joysticks one was cracked at base of stick (see my other review). The other two the trigger would not work (see other reviews about trigger}. Remember Amazon.Com will not replace this item after 30 days. I suggest you purchase another brand of joystick.,270
1,Whoever supplies for Amazon should be fired. These nails are obviously factory seconds. The nails were thrown in a generic box like a rat's nest (not the manufacturer's box) with most of the stick nails damaged. The nails could not be used in a nail gun as per the manufacturer....the nails were not complete sticks...just bits and pieces. (Think of trying to load a stapler with individual staples and you will get a sense of how these nails arrived.),452

1,To start with I LOVE Chinese/Korean/Japanese/Thai cinema. I have more than 300 titles and I made the BIG mistake of buying Blade of Kings. I am a huge Donnie Yen fan so I had no doubt that I would buy this Blu-Ray as soon as it came available. BIG MISTAKE! To begin with the two female leads were terrible. As was Jaycee Chen. Just don't mistake and get this film.,364
1,"As an avowed fan of the ""Prey"" series, I borrowed this book with the utmost expectations. Previous installments have been reading highlights, especially in areas of marginal character development and plotting.This leaden tome fails on all fronts, from its total lack of characterization to its stupendously inane deus ex machina conclusion. Let's sincerely hope that the estimable Mr. Sandford regains his footing in the next of the series.",440

1,"To start, one of the screws to secure the dongle in the DVI input was poorly inserted. I could not turn it easily. Once I did get it plugged in and secured with one screw, the video kept flickering on and off.Poorly made. Thank goodness for Amazon's no-hassle returns!",268
1,This was the most incorrect biography I have ever seen. It is written by a historical fictionist and is totally trying to bring Washington down. This movie was obviously an opinion. How could the author say those things about Washington. I highly recommend you don't watch it. It should not be used for children. You'll be teaching your kids incorrect things.,359
1,"I can't believe this film is a horrorfest. I know, I know, I know. Nothing fantastical about horrorfest films, but this one just plain stinks. Stupid, stupid, stupid plot, stupid actors, stupid dialogues; worse than the lowest of the low budget campy horrors. My gawd, it's just awful.",285
1,"This book was one of the required readings for a class I took years ago on Humans, Computer and Cognition. Unfortunately, I did not think highly of Donald Norman's opinions because I felt many of them were simply over generalizations. Perhaps this is because I have a background in psychology that includes learning and motivation. I found myself disagreeing with many of Norman's statements and routinely asking, ""What evidence is he basing that on?""",451
1,A lot of opinion dressed but as fact. Spotty writing and even spottier grasp of the subject. The author seems more interested in pounding his idiosyncratic viewpoint into the reader's head than in educationg them.,213

1,"This product (made overseas) is a terrible investment. The stitching unravels from the waistband prematurely causing the waistband to separate from the brief. I have purchased many pair of these, catching on a bit too slowly.

I am currently seeking a comparable ""Made in USA"" product.",483
1,"The author titled his book wrong. He should have called it, ""WWII in the Atlantic"" or ""U-Boat War"". 2/3 of this book is spent in the atlantic theater. The author gives the pacific theater about as much attention as you would find in a high school history book. Disappointing how the author can spend chapters on u-boat attacks on convoys and only gives a few small pages to battles like coral, midway...etc. The biggest Naval battle to date, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, gets next to no attention in this book. Save your money, pass on this book.",543

I did. The DVD's still did not work. I bought a second set of DVD's and tried both sets of DVD's on both the old and the new DVD player. Neither set of DVD's worked.

I thought maybe it had to do with the reset button or something, but no luck. If I still have the receipt, I'll try to return it and get something else.",473

Throughout the entire film I kept thinking the effects, while on one level were impressive, they were so unrealistic that they suspended my 'suspension of disbelief'. The movie really did deserve one star, but as I recently sat through ""Furry Vengeance"" I could not in good conscience lump it at the same level.",501

1,I've read countless numbers of Sci-Fi and fantasy tales and The Gift definately ranks as one of the lowest to me. The storyline had such great potential but the author chose not to use it. The plot jumps around as if the author wrote a chapter and stopped for a month then returning without looking back at what he previously wrote. The narrative was also somewhat childish. I looked forward to this book after reading the reviews. What a let down it proved to be! Mr. O'Leary please use better focus next time!!Adult reader Near Chicago.,538
1,"I have bootlegs that sound vastly better. As for the video footage, there is not one frame which is sharp and in focus. The only thing worse is the asinine commentary by journalist Chris Welch, who has nothing to say, and says it for the mercifully short duration of this disc. It's just possible that he was attempting deadpan ironic satire in the manner of This Is Spinal Tap, but the balance of probabilities is against it. I have rated this as a single star because Amazon will not allow me to give it none at all.",518
1,I did not like this book - did not even finish the first page. I am glad I did not waste my money on it - a friend loaned it to me and it was quickly returned. I do not care for Anne Rice books and feel that none of them are worth wasting my time as there are other Vampire novels that are better written and have more of a soul to them. Anne Rice just leaves me sad and tired.,377

1,"My first Barbara Vine book, and definitely the last. I persevered through about 2 thirds of the book and never once understood what was going on. Several little episodes failed to capture my attention or imagination, and I'm afraid I just couldn't face the struggle through the remainder - maybe that would have brought some meaning to the book, but by then, I just didn't care.",378

1,"This is more a story of embellished government incompetence and mud slinging toward brave men and women who fly into space. While the book is interesting enough to finish, it leaves you with a sense that Burroughs had to stick to the rumors and gossip to make this book fly. It was dissapointing in how few facts or science were cited.",335

1,Everything was going well for my four year old when the system shut down on the 4th song. New batteries and different AV connections to the other 5 open ports on my TV left me feeling like I had a lemon. I took it back and exchanged it for another brand new one. This time it took one song and it zonked out...AGAIN.Unreliable and not built to withstand a 4 year old girl??? What gives?!My system is being returned for good. This absolutely was the worst product I've ever purchased regardless of the price!,507
1,Sypro the dragon games were always fun except the GBA versions. But this is worse than that! And that was pretty bad to begin with. Like I said they were about fun and thinking but this game only focuses on toughness. And the boss namely Red cheat big time and everybody elde seems to have got stuiper even the Professor. And Blinx's levels are the worst with those hard jumps which is the easiest way to annoy a gamer. So from a pro don't get this game rent if you just want to see how lame the series has gotten.,514
1,"This book reads like a poor Spenser pastiche. It is banal and most unusually for Parker it meanders all over the place. Spenser novels used to be witty light reads with pretty good mysteries. This has a really silly plot and also way too much heavy handed sermonising ,yet again ,which slows things down enormously.I agree that the author should retire as ,although easy money for him, this is beyond embarrassing.",414
1,"Initially I wasn't even going to give this ""novel"" one star, but, since it turned out to be the perfect width to stabilize my wobbly photo basket, I decided it wasn't totally worthless.

1,This movie literally borrows scenes from many action movie. It is full of plot holes...The story is OK. The DVD has OK amount of features. Rent this pathetic movie first(unless you like Treat Williams or B grade action movies!). I would go into details about the many plot holes but that would ruin it for other readers/viewers. Just be sure you rent this movie first before you buy it!,386
1,"I bought this for my daughter. I have tried to get to work on 2 different PC's (which have more than the requirements needed) and nothing. One fails to load, and on the other the projects come up a blurry mess. Fisher Price says I need DirectX 10, which is not in the requirements (and the app installs version 9 so I figure that is BS). Not happy at all. Good luck to those who try this out.",392
1,"This product, Michael's Water Balance Factors, was felt to be my last hope since I had lost my ability to secure the prescription diuretic Lasix (generic form: Furosemide). For more than four years, the prescription drug had worked effectively in terms of aiding my high blood pressure and tendency toward fluid retention. Suffice it to say that the OTC product proved to be virtually useless, potentially causing more harm than good. From a personal standpoint, I am definitely unable to recommend this product.",512

1,this so called movie id not scary at the slightest. 1 of the worst things in the whole movie is that this guy falls in love with a woman normal right not when the woman is a ghost. you just start to find out why they died and who the ghost are at least half way in the movie. even though they ARE IN THE HOUSE from the beginning of the movie. never see it. the only reason why i rate it a 1 star is because i got to rate it a star.,431
1,"I think the CD I received from Amazon a few weeks ago is the same as the one I am reviewing. My CD is called ""The Tenors"" and features Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras. The recordings of Domingo and Carreras were of good quality, but not so for those of Pavarotti. The sound was extremely variable and some portions were barely audible. Some of Pavarotti's selections included female vocalists, but no credits were given. Overall, I was disappointed in the CD.",459
1,"Although this book does explore some fans' intimate moments, it seems to only favor a certain ""type"" of Manilow fan -- the ones with all the time and money in the world to go chasing Barry across the country every time he's on tour! For those of us with a life who are experts at his music, who consider him a central inspiration in our lives, but can't go to every appearance, this book is not a description.

1,"This movie is a dark romance/tragedy. Four people come together in the end but it takes most of the movie to figure out what is going on. It left me with a feeling of 'Is this all there is... you must be kidding'. Overall, the acting is as good as the plot allows. This is not an action flick. Franklyn is not a super hero or a comic book villian. I guess it is not my kind of movie.",383
1,"I read parts of this aloud as examples of bad writing. This is HORRIBLE! The story is muddled. Cliches abound. The characters are poorly depicted. Where is the inner turmoil the vampire showed in the movie ""Dracula's Daughter""? Why did he so strangely change the werewolf's shapeshifting nature to a method unrelated to that of the movies? Since when do Dracula and his daughter invoke Satan? If you're not going to stick to what has been established in the movies, then just write an original novel with your own material and characters.

1,This movie is one of the worst ones I have ever watched. The only reason I watched it the whole way through was because my mom bought it for me at my request and I would have felt guilty if I hadn't. This movie had the worst effects I have ever seen - even a 1920's movie would be better than this! The plot - horrible/stupid/idiotic! The acting itself was much to be desired.

1,I found this book insulting and absolutely false.As many of the other reviews have said anyone who plays this game and ends up murdering someone was already screwed up before they began playing the game. No one who i play with would ever think of doing one of the devil-worshipping acts. We are all very normal too we have all played sports on a team and we are all very smart.

I used the unit to help boil water that was also heated with another heater and as it came to a vigorous boil the boiling around the Norpro was very evident... for about five seconds when it stopped. That was the end of the unit. So it's possible to kill this thing even if you keep it properly submerged in boiling water.

1,"A half-dozen characters gradually join together, sort of, and an enormous amount of space is wasted on backchat, while the central action gets slighted. The only real drama comes from scenes of burned out massacred villages, as if the author must keep our interest by evoking real historical horrors, because otherwise the book's contents are so uninteresting. I like fantasy tales, but to work they require storytelling skill, a sense of action and direction which this book lacks.",482

1,Complete rip off. Like buying a bag of oregano. Dylan appears only briefly and entire video was filmed without any sound. Mickey Jones narrates the whole thing and more than half is just him sitting in his studio being interviewed. Jones is disgusting to look at and so is this video.,284
1,"I have many years of diaper changing experience under my belt and have used many brands of wipes. I wanted to like these wipes, but they fell short of my expectations and smelled strange to boot. They are small, insufficiently moist, have poor cleaning ability, and a bizarre chemical-sweet smell to them (they are marketed as unscented!) We were happy to get through the seemingly endless supply and were pleased to be reunited with our tried-and-true Kirkland wipes, which are the best bang for the buck in my opinion.",520
1,"I got this new set hoping for a perfectly clean barrel after every play. Soon after i recieved it i realized the ""rabbit's foot"" didnt fit in my barrel and it angered me incredibly bad. I trimmed the stupid cotton off for about twenty minutes, leaving a mess of dust and fabric in the air, and a lot of residue in my barrel. The cotton swab works very well though, and overall the squeege does remove the leftover paint. BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS KIT!!!!",462
1,"The discs in this series are faulty. Disc 2 is especially bad. There was skipping in Disc 1. I'm not sure where the seller got this ""new"" set, but it's disappointing. Love the series, but not with all the skipping.",214

1,"Greg Iles has been a favorite, but he falls very short here. Characters are shallow, plot is very contrived. The ""computer is taking over the world"" is pretty overdone and its tough to believe that the main character is GOD,A real disappointment",245
1,I wish I could give this less than one star. It stinks. I spend more time cleaning out the clogs and various filters than I actually do cleaning the carpet.,156
1,I bought this book for my mom who recently received a beautiful orchid plant. Anyone who has seen an orchid knows COLOR is one of the important factors in an orchid and to see the pictures in this book illustrated in B/W is a huge disappointment. The price was right but the product wasn't.,290
1,"i didnt like this product because when i opened the box right after i got it it was broke. the wheel is broke, the vise is broke, and the outer part is broke. i tried calling the number in the package to let them know it was broken when it arrived and all i got was a bus signal. i can not get ahold of buffalo tools.",317
1,"I don't know who Mr Chambers wrote this book for, but it was not for those of us who have new iMacs and who are new to the world of Macs. His information is not up to date, his instructions do not apply, he seems more interested in being a humorist than in providing good solid help.",283
1,"Just like the reviewer from Moblie said, nothing is wrong with sampling but when ALL your songs are samples... We can't really give Puff Daddy no credit until he proves he can make some good ORIGINAL music -- if that is something he can do at all. Considering that the man has no mike skills either, this album is really unforgivable.",334
1,"Well, my son (who is almost 3) loves to bounce on this one zebra type toy, but he is too big for it. I thought for sure he would love this toy. He was very excited, at first. We have had it for over a month and he rarely uses it. I think he may use it more when he gets older, but for now it is just sitting in our living room mainly collecting dust.",350
1,"Bobby Wolff wrote only a 1 page preface. Take his name off of the add for this book.The information in the book is only applicable to rubber bridge.

1,"Listen to the others when they say this game is bad... I wish i would have seen them first. This game is so rudimentary- it basically points you in the direction of the clues and outcomes- there is no searching and finding like an adventure game, you canot walk around and look at things- you can only point and click. This was a total waste of my $$$ and I plan on returning this item!",386
1,"This should have been entitled ""The things people say to comfort you.""..... you know, the types who grasp your hand with a brimming sense of their wisdom as you bury your child and say ""it will all look better in the morning"" and ""god knows best"" and such. A horrible book to put out there for some unsuspecting soul who might really need a glimpse of a happy life. Apparently this was originally a graduation speech: let's hope those seniors found something more than mush thereafter.",485

1,"This is pretty much the worst book ever written. It is, however, good for kindling for a fire in the winter time. Or, it can be used as fuel for a bon fire in your backyard. This book is filled with propaganda and hate-speech. Just look at the publisher. That should give you an idea of how bad it is.",301
1,"I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny.",511

I used the thermometer provided with the EuroCuisine yogurt making machine. Everything should have worked out fine, but it didn't. This yogurt starter just doesn't work.I have a lot of success using just plain yogurt from Walmart as my starter, and it's a lot cheaper too.",465
1,"I bought this book because when I was pregnant I enjoyed reading Your Pregnancy Week by Week. Don't waste your money. All the bad reveiws on this page are spot-on. The only thing I have to add is that baby's develop SO differently, trying to monitor it week by week will drive you crazy. Especially when, like one reviewer pointed out, the milestones the author is claiming your child will be hitting is SO OFF.",411
1,"Plot, story, development, premises... all just ridiculous and terrible. Don't even bother renting this one and certainly don't buy it.",134

1,"I know Halloween is a classic, but it would be nice if it was a good classic. This is the second worst movie I've ever seen(the worst is Friday The 13th). I like to watch horror movies but watching this is just a wast of time. Almost the whole movie is boring, it's not scary at all and it's just very poorly made. If you want something scary go buy The Amityville Horror, that movie is good. Halloween does not deserve to be a classic, so don't waste your time and money!",472

1,"This is the girls watch, picture makes it look like a guys. Was not happy to have to return and pay a $15 restocking fee because they can't properly advertise their product. I found the guys version on ebay. Like most watches it should say men's or ladie's.",257
1,"The author obviously has never seen a public healthcare system. Healthcare research continues through private auspices in Europe, Canada and elsewhere despite public insurance coverage.This fantasy of a totalitarian medicare state may be satisfying for the ignorant or ideologically blind, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with the way healthcare is provided in most of the world outside of the United States of America.",423

1,"While I found some parts of the novel to be rather far-fetched, I found many good explanations of an emerging technology and its potential dangers. I would have liked to have read this book to my 11 year old son who would have been fascinated. Unfortunately, the book is filled with foul language which, in my opinion, does nothing to enhance the story or the message that it carries. I am disapponted that a writer of his caliber should find it necessary to do this and I find that it detracts greatly from the book.",517

1,"I purchased this item for my son a few years ago for Christmas. After a few months, one set broke and if you rotated your wrist too far left or right, the individual weights would fall off onto the ground. They are useless. It's worth it to just purchase regular hand weights if you are so inclined. I would not recommend this product or this brand at all. I knew I was not purchasing top of the line equipment but for $50, I expected a better product.",452
1,"I was promised a tragic masterpiece, grandly entertaining, wisecracking, eloquent, heartbreaking beauty. What I got was a tiresome story about truly dysfunctional people who I would never want to associate with, so why waste my time reading about them? You guessed it -- I didn't like this book and I only got through half of it before opting to read something I'd enjoy. With all the literature out there, why spend precious time with annoying people you can't stand?",468
1,This was our second and last Rowenta iron. Both models we purchased ended up leaking everywhere after about a year of use and just out of date of the warranty. I just expected an $80 iron to have a better life span and it really is too bad because when it wasn't leaking everywhere it did a great job.,301
1,I was a little lost watching this movie. It didn't really make sense to me. What woman invites another woman into their relationship.,133
1,I am a bit baffled that this film is labeled an adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's masterpiece. The only things it shares with the novel are characters' names and the time period. This film single-handedly dismantles an American classic. Classics should NOT be tampered with. This is a laughable attempt at making a film from this timeless novel. I find nothing redeemable about it at all.,390

1,"After spending time online looking at different bulletin boards similar to this one that I could hang all of my students name from and create a cute little display, I was sadly disappointed when this came in the mail. The picture makes it look a lot larger than it really is, and when it said it included 20 miniature stockings I assumed that it would fit all of them. It doesn't. It fit maybe half of them along the top of the hearth.",435

1,"I was REALLY REALLY thrilled when I learned that this movie was going to be released on DVD and placed order instantaneously. However, I was REALLY REALLY disappointed when I received it because the movie is split into 2 on a 2-side disc!!!This is clearly an insult to the customers. I wish Amazon could've indicated earlier, so that I could avoid buying it. I'd rather wait until they release a more decent version with the whole movie on 1 disc and the extras on another disc! Shame on you, Universal Studios, for doing this kind of ""unethical"" thing!",553
1,"The narration is a bore. The transfer to DVD is horrendous...there is frequent flickering on the screen.

I was very happy at first but became less and less as time passed. Even when it was new and out of the box it was very time consumingThis is not a very good product. I like Hoovers products but not this one.,377
1,I am so dissapointed in this book as it is nothing like I had expected. I will be returning it.,95
1,"I am so disappointed! I searched the reviews to find out the order in which to read this series only to find out that the first is not in Kindle format. I'm very disappointed, but at least I can choose from other authors. I guess I won't be reading this series beacause I don't want to read it without reading the first one and I will not buy a paperback or hard cover when I have a Kindle. Hopefully this will come out in Kindle edition soon.",443
1,Christopher Caliendo's score is very weak. Why he was chosen or why the original score was replaced is a mystery. This score is perfunctory at best. It does not work in this film at all.,186
1,"Awful product. Claims that it cuts 1/2 foam board, but it doesn't. It will go probably 3/4 of ways though that's it. Piece of crap.",131
1,This wallet is beautiful to look at but it frayed immediately upon putting credit cards into slot.,98
1,"well its bad brains,and its live. the mix doesent come close to the fatness of""youth are getting restless""live. and h.r. just sounds mental and drugged out, spewing incoherent babble in between jams most of the set. where is the energy? it sounds like an off night. but if you love the band,it certainly belongs in the collection. maybe if i just got really out of my head hammered,i would be right there with h.r.and it would all make sense. i highly recommend ""the youth are getting restless"" live in amsterdam 87. it crushes all over this one...peace",553
1,"After reading just a little of this book you can stop turning pages because it's obvious what's going to happen next. Boring and predictable; I've read this book before, written much better, but never worse. Nothing new or original here. I've run into these stock characters many times before and that was more than enough. For me this was a waste of time. Has the obligatory sex scenes: yuck. Secret History of the Pink Carnation should not be allowed in same room with books by Austen or Heyer.",496
1,"It seemed like it would be a smashing album. But after a listen to it i felt i had been ripped off 17$. The mixing is slow dull and lets you fall asleep. Disc 2 is simply bad, the annoyingly sample filled carnival xiii hurts to listen too, With west on the 27th being the only highlight. This disc has parks in wilson is slow mellow form. Disc 1 is a little better. slightly faster. but still nothing impressive.",412
1,"The work of a known spammer. Note all the 1 star (because there's no zero star option) reviews. Many mention how he spams... add to that list a fake MySpace profile.Notice all the people that found this review ""unhelpful""?Yeah, they're all from the spammer ""writer"" too.",270
1,"This book was very good back when it was first published, unfortunately it only gave decklists and not advice on mana curve, the land:spell proportions, or things like that. So, as of 2004, it's not fit unless you're playing type 1, or extended.",245
1,"Macworld magazine quoted Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, late Tuesday having said that the broken screens were due to a ""vendor quality issue"". Apple finally admits it.So to everyone who called those with broken/scratched Nanos idiots and liars, I say call yourself lucky that your's isn't one of the duds, and ask that you apologize to those you flamed.To those stuck with the broken units, get back with Apple and demand a replacement of your DEFECTIVE unit.I still would give this thing 0 stars if it were an option",563

1,"There are many errors in this book. It is very thick but many pages are filled with useless analogies. It is badly written and does not cover many of the concepts in the PMPBOK. There are typing errors in there. The questions at the end of the chapters do not discus the more important concepts of the chapters, but rather are put there so that the author can advertise that there are more than 300 questions in the book. The main purpose for this book is to allow the author to advertise his bootcamp. This book was not very useful.",533

1,The product details for this product fail to state how many mg EGCG are in each capsule. How can anyone buy supplements online without knowing this very basic info?,164
1,"First off, the packaging is beautiful, but this is nothing more than an audience recording, so the sound is just terrible. Why is it that Asia seems completely unable to issue these live albums with a soundboard source tape. Why go with an audience recording that just doesn't sound that good and put it out on CD? Asia is a great band, but here it just seems like they are ripping people off with an inferior sounding product in a fabulous package.",449
1,The pan in the picture has a nice wide cutout to accommodate the plug end of the heating element. The pans which arrived did not have a sufficient cutout and I had to cut some metal out with the tin snips to allow the burner to sit flat on the stove top. I specifically ordered what I thought was going to match the photo. My stove is a GE so I assumed what I would get would work without modification. The joke was on me.,422

1,"I like Ellen Degeneres. I think she has been an excellent emcee on award programs, her own talk show and her sitcom - which was canceled and shouldn't have been. I had this book on my ""Wish List"" and received it from a family member for Christmas. I really looked forward to reading it. I settled in expecting to be laughing out loud, but I never did. I expected the book to get better as I continued to read it - it NEVER did! All in all quite a disappointment.",462
1,"I am not at all fond of this product. I found it very hard to use and keep between my legs. I have knee problems and was hoping this would work for them. Sadly, a regular pillow works much better",195
1,"I thought that this book was about technical analysis of the stock market. What I found was a book that was over my head in its content. I tried to read the chapters but got bored halfway to about 3/4's the way through. So I skimmed the rest of the chapters trying to make sense of what she was trying to teach. At this time, the book was a waste of money.",356
1,"This book is so useless that I feel compelled to write a review to warn others to stay away from this book. A good tutorial should inspire the user on what he/she can do with the product. This book leads you to believe that without talent, the only thing you can do with Illustrator is to draw circles and squares. The book is a disservice to both the reader and to Adobe Illustrator.",384
1,There are too many story lines going on in this movie. I found it boring and annoying to watch. I hoped the superstar cast meant it was going to be good but I was very wrong! There were moments of comedy that kept md from rating this a meager 1 star but not enough to keep me interested.,287
1,"This is just terrible.I am not interesting in cattle farming. John Marsden is. Very, VERY interested. His war stories have been replaced by details on how to birth cattle, and what kind of timetable farmers follow.Then he gets bored with that and starts making discriminatory blonde jokes.And that's not to mention the endless tales of the world's most stupid and annoying child: Gavin.Do yourself a favour and avoid the follow-ups to the Tomorrow series.",455

1,I was holding a poker charity event and needed lots of chips ASAP and Amazon was great at shipping quickly BUT the Fat Cat Chip Set didn't come with any white chips as it was supposed to. These are usually used to represent one dollar chips and that is the demonination I needed the most. The event was the night after I received the set so I couldn't send it back.,365

1,My White MDR-EX81 has now disintegrated where the rubber wire coating has rips in many places and very gummy and sticky. It is as if it is melting away. Bad chemistry. It's easily tangled and irritating to undo it - also due to sticky coating. This product has been discontinued by SONY. Do not buy this product!!!,314
1,This has got to be the cheapest made stock I have ever seen I do not recommend it and am going to just throw it away!,117
1,"I was really excited when i read the reviews. I always thought that these dancy type workouts never really gave you a workout. But i decided to purchase this DVD anyways since everyone gave such good marks. Unfortunately my original instinct was right. The difficult steps didn't really bother me because i was able to pick them up after a couple of times, but i just didn't feel like i got this great workout when i was done. I didn't really sweat or get my heart rate up much. It's too bad, because i really like Allison and her DVD's.",537
1,"I have a laptop with Bluetooth built-in and I wanted a full-size Bluetooth mouse to use with it.Many of the applications I use rely heavily on the middle mouse button. Unfortunately, the middle button on this mouse does not respond properly, making for a very frustrating experience.Also, the clickless wheel sounds like a good idea, but I enjoy a little tactile feedback from the wheel.Why can't Microsoft simply take their nice, basic mouse, and make a Bluetooth version of it without trying to add a bunch of new ""features"" to try and justify the high price?",561
1,"I bought one a year a go..was excellent but I forgot it on the rain and damaged.So I bought another one,when I saw it I feel so fragile if compare with the firt one ,the cords more fragil,no light on the plug to indicate is on.I used two times..I set around 50 minutes to warm my food and the heat wasnt good like the first one.Something isnt right.I would like to return it and buy another brand..but to much work for return..I'm trying to buy one from the brand Burton..Looks like more quality..Sorry koolatron..You used cheap materials on this one!!",552

1,The hearing aids I currently use are heavy on batteries. The ICell Tech batteries last from 15 minuets to a day and a half. Most of them have lasted about 10 hours. Will never buy these batteries again. Costco batteries last me about 2 days. I sent my aids in for recalibration and was informed this is the nature of my current aids.The company I bought the batteries from were OK . Prompt with the shipping and well packed,423
1,"It was funny and easy to read. Sounded an awful like a really mad, long ""letter to the editor"" that come out in local papers in the editorial section. All she tries to do in sell books, nothing more. She is a joke to any true conservastive who is not married to their cousin.",275

1,"Probably a mistaken impression, but when I read book 3- I thought we were going to see some interaction with the high court seelie- the entire thing seemed to be leading to a party with Meredith going head to head with Taranus.In book4, there was nothing....

One book arrived the next week and the other book has yet to arrive. After next week I will no longer even need the book that I am still waiting on. When I wrote the company they said it was on its way, but that was quite a while ago. I purposefully chose a company that posted both books and was located close enough to get the books in time for class.",491
1,"This is yet another book rushed into publication to capitalize on a hot topic. I read the book as carefully as I could and thought it was a pointless recitation of facts.

1,"Time has done it's dirty deed - there's nothing here that strikes a chord. Keith is still magnificient - one of the rock keyboard greats. No voices left. To boot, the price on this set is exorbitant for a 100 minute concert and a 22 minute interview. Don't bother!!",265
1,If there was a rating of no/negative stars this film definately desreves it. The slasher movie genre has returned and like it's hey day in the late 70's and mid 80's it's grtting tiring.The plot has the depth of a cheap porno with a cast of nobodys and never will be.,267

1,"After owning and using a real Bowflex for years, this item pales in comparison. Cheap construction (the seat pad is already falling apart), poor design (the seat will not adjust to a good position to do upper body exercices) and limited function (only one exercise for the legs). For $400.00 you do not get much. I would recomend finding a used Bowflex.",353

1,Looking at the picture you would expect that you are getting a set. You get one short piece 12 x 6 and nothing else ... no instructions ... nothing. You can get the same item on bodytrends website for 9.95. What a waste of money!,229
1,"Dissappointingly simplistic. If you have read ANYTHING about smoking a brisket or ever made a reasably good effort, then you have surpassed the level of this book.",163
1,"A very disappointing book about a fascinating subject. Goldsmith appeals neither to the evolutionary biologist nor the casual interested party with this work. No cohesive thoughts run through the book, and Goldsmith is never sure exactly who the audience of his book really is. Examples are strewn together with nothing to tie them together or into a central theme. You can do much better than this book.",404

1,"This product was definately a waste of money. It is pretty, and appears to be high quality craftsmanship; but it is lacking in design functionality. The biggest flaw is that it does not include any place to store the stylus. Secondly, the Archos is not securely held in this unit. It really needs a strap across the top or something in addition to the side clips. Also, there is no way to access the charging port without removing the unit from the case. Who needs a stand for a product with its own stand anyway?",513
1,"I saw the names of all the cool singers on this cd track listing and thought this will be good, how wrong I was the only two tracks that come close to being rock or close to the originals were the two versions of Shout at the Devil.

1,I don't think that there's one song on this CD that sounds different than any other. Each track sounds the exact same. There's no variety. It just repeats itself over and over. It's like a broken record. Get the drift? And where did this band go? Are they desperately wanting a new CD to come out or what?,305

1,"One has to wonder if the author simply cannot come up with any more mysteries for Qwill to solve; these were too short, too abrupt, too ""re-runnish""--we have read some of these elsewhere in her work--and simply too flat. No substance, and the terseness makes them one-dimensional. Why does Qwill sound like a pompous ass in the few interjections he makes herein? The author cannot be so strapped for money she is simply trying to cash in on the past, can she? One hopes not indeed, because of the many past hours of reading pleasure she has afforded us.",553
1,"I no longer have RED STAR RISING with which to compare this novel, but it is my recollection that this is merely a rewrite of it with only the names of the characters and countries changed and the military equipment brought up to date! I feel cheated! I won't read Clancy ever again!!!!!",287

1,"The only thing I really like about this product is the 10"" screen .It's too gaudy and akward to handle . The disk is hard to remove because of the small space provided for your finger to fit into to remove it . The door you have to open to load the disk is way to big. Picture quality is good . Sound is fair . I use this product only once and a blue . But I'm sure someone who may use it often would have a problem with the single hinge in the middle . Unless you left it mounted in your car ...",496

1,"How can anyone still feed this to children? I cannot believe that, given the medical research evidence about the dangers of artificial colors and flavors (of which Wacky Mac and the other Fould's prodcuts have several), anyone would give this to children.

1,What can you suspect from this movie? The acting wasn't that bad but the whole story was probably thought up from a thirteen year old. The only reason I'm giving this film 2 stars is because it's an independent film and it looked as if the director tried to make a good horror film.,282

1,"Rarely have I been this disappointed in a book. It claims to be the history of Winchester which is certainly is not. What it is is page after page of very low quality black and white photos of Winchester firearms accompanied by a simplistic, broad brush description of each.

1,"I agree with Rich from Canada. Not again..., November 18, 2000 I was disappointed with Crown of Swords and Winter's Heart is even further evidence that Mr Jordan has run out of ideas or is trying to milk the series for all the money he can get. This series has become a soap opera with no action, no plot, and no momentum; ""just endless scenes of pointless bickering, traveling, and whining, with a tiny bit of action thrown in at the end of each book"". I will wait until the next one is in the library before reading it.",521

1,"This is not a review of the text itself, but rather just of the production value of this edition. The production is AWFUL. It was clearly just scanned by someone and imported into Word and printed out. Chapter breaks aren't where they should be. Footnotes are just thrown into the text. One chapter just starts italicizing for no reason halfway through. The index is useless. The book is basically unreadable. I've never been so disappointed at spending $20 on a book. Buy a different version by a different publisher and save yourself the money.",546

1,"I thought this was one of the worst books ever written. It has so much historical distortions that fit neatly into a radical feministic viewpoint of the biblical times. This book demonizes males of the biblical times. Furthermore, it takes the central character and tries to make us believe that a girl who is barely into puberty can have a deep romantic sexual experience and fall deeply in love with an adolescent male after just meeting him. The entire book is contrived. Furthermore, it is an insult and affront to the Old Testament.",537
1,"Now wait a minute: ""her deep contralto""? She attempts a deep contralto, yes, but her voice--to the extent she has one--is mezzo soprano. Her deadpan delivery might have its twisted charm if she sang in her true range and if she weren't consistently flat...but, hey, who needs it? There exist in the world real singers. Really.",326
1,"Although the concept of this heater seemed great, it did not live up to expectations. I had to return it twice before giving up on it entirely. It did heat the space quite nicely, but it would randomly just shut off on its own. When I contacted the company the first time, they said it should never shut off unless turned off. This was critical in my case because I was concerned about freezing temperatures - not acceptable.",425
1,"This cd has great reviews and I got it after hearing Shelton's version of ""Goodbye Time"". I was disappointed with the cd but I can't say I'm surprised. Aside from ""Goodbye Time"", which is a great country ballad, the cd is lacking any standout tracks. It is a great example of the cookie cutter formula being used in Nashville today. Some of these songs may be radio-friendly and may be hit singles for Shelton but there is nothing here that people will remember in a few years or even a few months.",498

1,"What a snooze. This book tries to talk about life in Tuscany but ends up being a baby-boomer, yuppie expression of how to spend money, cook food, and not be a member of a community. The writing, while descriptive, is not evocative and does not give the reader the feeling of the cover photo. Like some other reviewers, I would get excited when she started talking about *life* in Tuscany or Italy (like the example of her husband and driving) and then she would slip back into recipes for the next meal. Disappointing based on the hype.",536
1,"If you are a fan of fictional genocides, this is a good read. If you are interested in the complete truth, you have to read other books. In the period mentioned in the book, practically everybody was killing everybody else in a country torn by ethnic strife fueled by imperialist foreigners. Innocent ethnic Greeks were killed, yes, but keep in mind that lots of innocent Turks also perished. Calling this kind of nightmare a ""genocide"" is just an inappropriate use of the word.",478
1,"Unless you are a HUGE fan of the Alien movies do not waste your time on Prometheus. Even then, be warned. Bad sets, special effects, and horrible writing mar what should have been a great start to the prequels. There are so many plot holes it will drive you insane. A huge disappointment.",288

It could be that our one year old has knocked it off the fridge several times, but we also own the LeapFrog Fridge Phonics set which we got when my now four year old was one. It has been knocked off the fridge and batted around MUCH more that the Word Whammer and it still works. I would not recommend this item.",565

1,"This game is terribly pure and simple. First, the graphics are poor, the players looked distorted, with overally large heads and feet. Second, the game play and controls are poor, with the game handling nothing like real college basketball, and poor button placements. Finally, reality? They can't even get stadiums correct on the inside. They don't look anything like what they are supposed to be. Save your money, if you really want a good college basketball game, get ESPN College Hoops, you won't be dissappointed.",518

Not the fluffy, crunchy popcorn that the Nordicware makes (even without adding any oil or anything to the popcorn in either machine). The reason I tried the air popper was because it can make more popcorn at once.I will be returning the air popper, and will continue to use the Nordicware microwave popper.",493

I am not going to say that Norah Jones is a bad singer, she is better than many prefabricated pop singers, but in no way is she better than contemporary vocal jazz singers like Holly Cole. If you want something new from the regular classics like Fitzgerald or Vaughan you are way better off buying a Holly Cole album. You won't regret it.",520

1,"I bought this CD because my friends told me they were a good band. I popped it into my CD Player, skipped to the featured track, played it, and turned it off 20 seconds later. I listened to about 4 more of the songs, all ones that i heard were good, and i gave the CD away later that day. The horns section is WAY too loud, the vocals are annoying and horrible, and this is probably the worst ska band out there. If you want REAL ska, check out Less Than Jake, or NOFX, they are a million times better than this crap.",517

1,"As an artist looking to enhance my skill set I was looking for a book that would bridge the gap. This book however, fell pretty flat. For one the majority (over 60%) of the diagrams are very lack luster and rudimentary pencil sketches that will not help anyone with even a remote drawing ability. It doesn't help anyone who wishes to see how the muscle groups and joint actually move either. I would suggest you pay a little more money and get the professional anatomy books that are available.",494
1,"This book is pretty awful and am very disappointed. He usually writes good books, this one is not. The first 250 pages are repetitive and sooooo boring.

Panasonic would not stand by their product and I was unable to get the camera fixed without a substantial fee. After four calls I was unsatisfied and the camera still cannot zoom. At a store I found that the zoom lever easily comes off. Avoid this product. There are too many cheap factors that can ruin the great features. Technical and customer support are useless.",499

Before I started to read this book I read DirectX Complete (by Michael D. Root, James R. Boer; Paperback) which is a well structured and good (beginners)book ( in this book you learn something new about games on each page..). In Kawicks may learn something about RTS after 200 pages of reading. The lack of good programming samples and to much bla, bla makes this book a total waste to buy.",555

That is stupid. We don't want to be reminded of things like this when we go to the movies. I wanna see a horror movie, not your stupid macho right wing propaganda. Nice movie Fox. Next time you try to fill the entertainment industry with this waste of my time, do it for a movie that doesn't completely suck. Wes Craven? Can you say...SELL OUT?",539

She's tormented by the death of her former lover for years. Nightmares, cold sweats, you name it, we hear about it in detail.If the heroine had just taken herself a little less seriously maybe I'd have liked it.

1,Such a letdown after Girl in Hyacinth Blue. This book has none of Girl's poetry or soul. For a better written depiction of Artemisia try Alexandra Lapierre. And no characterization of Galileo can top Sobel. It seems as if Vreeland was writing to make a deadline or fulfill a contract for that critical second book. It's not written from the heart.,347

One would have to be pretty low on the vocabulary food chain to be incapable of readily summoning to mind almost any of the synonyms listed in this book. Also, the quotations sacrifice the sublime for the politically correct, and are therefore equally lacking in excellence. Don't buy it unless you are in the lower 20% of the populace in verbal facility, for you will be wasting your money.",526
1,"The author tries to explain components as gnomes which work for you, machine code as instruction booklet for gnomes and so on. Throuhgout the whole book, he uses this rather confusing language.

If you already have some knowledge of COM and DCOM, at the end of this book you do not know more than in the beginning.",468

1,"The most amusing part of this movie is how they parody the real division in our political system, but once you get beyond that the movie comes across as kind of stupid with a few amusing parts thrown in here and there. I like Will Ferrell, but he does basically the same thing in almost every movie and its become old news.

I feel that I should get some reward for enduring this torture. This movie could have been 30 minutes less and it might have had a chance. The first 30 minutes are good, but you can shut it off after that. Go for a walk or something. You'll be glad you did.But seriously, don't watch it.",476
1,I have always been crazy about Millhiser's books but this is the exception. A zillion Characters (and I really mean character with a capital C) and an obtuse plot make this hard to follow. There is no way I can recommend this book. Buy The Mirror instead.,255
1,"I still have about 50 pages left however I desperately need a break after forcing myself through the first 230 pages of this god awful book. While the overall plot could have been a real winner Mankell fails to write a story that has kept me interested by any means. It is slow, dull, uneventful, and the characters are lifeless. I know that real life murder investigations aren't the stuff movies are made of but I read crime fiction books for entertainment and this is far from entertaining.",493

For as great as a gift and spiritual knowledge this book contains the font was WAY to small for my father to read..Even I had to strain to read it and Im in my mid 20's with great Vision.Great Content. But they seemed to have crammed tooo much onto each page. I don't recommend it for someone hard of sight or without PERFECT vision.,409

1,"I was looking for pure devotional service to Krishna, but this film only shows conditional service with God as an order supplier. Krishna has to fulfill all the material wishes of his devotee to ""fix"" his life. This is hardly the essence of pure bhakti.

It's rare to find such great souls who understand these things. They weren't writing and directing this movie.",516

1,"Seeing the trailer many times before the movie came out, it looked like one of the strongest movies in atmosphere in past couple of years. When seeing the movie, I was disappointed to such a high extent. Very limited in action, and attempted to be philisophically strong but just proved it redundant. This movie was easily the biggest disappointment in 2003. If you didn't see it, I highly advise it stay that way and watch something like Freddy vs. Jason or 28 Days Later (better horror movies in 2003).",504
1,"I find these disgusting. Who came up with this?Even if I found the dolls acceptable (which I don't), they certainly shouldn't be pushed on young children.

1,"This hand blender does work effectively. The big problem is cleaning the mixing wand. The metal core of the wand is encased in a plastic sleeve. Whatever you are mixing finds its way inside the plastic sleeve. It is impossible to get inside the sleeve to clean it out. You can see the accumulated scum inside. It appears very unsanitary. I emailed Hamilton Beach about the problem. They never answered. The HB web site has replacement parts, but they don't offer pictures of replacement wands so you know whether they have resolved this design defect.",551

1,"I bought this mug because it had the THERMOS brand name. It does a terrific job of keeping the coffee hot. However, it is terrible at letting you actually get the coffee into your mouth. The slide lid does not regularly open the air hole so sometimes you get nothing and next time you get a mouth full of hot liquid. You never know what you are going to get when you tip, either a tiny, tiny sip or a burned mouth. They need to throw this lid away and start new. I cannot believe it is still on the market.",506

1,"This album lacks the musicianship of their other releases. I understand what they were trying to do, but the cd is more about the producer than them. Little to no guitar, sax and keyboard solos and intricate melodies. Stanton must have been bored drumming the same hip hop beat through the whole cd.

I seen the application of many Biblical Principals throughout this entire movie. Light vs. Dark. Characters dealing with trials and wanting to make things right.

While her art style has definately grown, her characters are great and; being the sappy romantic that I am, I love her stories. When you've got a character who gets hounded by a guy younger than her and yet turns it all around, you gotta love it. Sorry, no spoilers here. Buy the manga and check it out for yourself.",503

Susan Wise Bauer does a good job handling some rather difficult and unpleasant parts of History. She did choose to leave out a couple of topics, but explains her reasons at the beginning. My only complaint is the lack of church history that is covered. (There seems to be a decreasing amount of church history covered in each successive volume.)",511

By stripping away peripheral issues, removing dogmatic programs, and concentrating on the singular task of getting alcohol and drugs out of your life, this book is a must-read for anyone trying to get clean and sober. There is no higher power at work here. There is no comfy-cozy group of enablers here, telling you to just hang in there. This book is a challenge, and there is only one ""step.""Don't drink or use. Period.",497
2,"When I first listened to this disc, I was put off by its lack of melody. ""Nefertiti"" has a repeating motif (repeating too often, actually), and ""Masqualero"" has a melody. The rest seems like open jamming on a chord pattern.With Miles, Wayne Shorter, and Herbie Hancock, repeated listening to the playing and soloing pulls you in, and every note eventually becomes memorable. It gets to the point where you wouldn't want to change a note.I wasn't familiar with the songs before I got this disc, a veteran Davi listener may have a different reaction.",548
2,Enjoyed this DVD & the personal insights it gave. I liked the singing too !Trevor Baldwin New Zealand,101
2,"Diana's single amazed me. I was cheering for her throughout the whole American Idol season, and I felt sure her single would be amazing. All three songs are beautiful and Diana sings them with passion and strong feeling. They'll send chills up your spine, yet they're all very catchy and you'll find yourself singing them often. ;) Must-buy for anyone who enjoys good music!",374
2,This film is hilarious. I watched it on new years eve in Denmark when I was an exchange student in 2004. I love it. Been trying to get a version of it here in the states for years.,180
2,"We enjoyed watching this show to see one of Elvis' best performances. We have recently rediscovered Elvis and thought it was a heartfelt understanding of him as a person. This DVD is organized pretty well...and if someone wants a single DVD of Elvis on stage, this is the one to buy.",283
2,"I have never laughed so hard at a tv snow. I am a social worker and was told ""every social worker needs to watch this show"" and it is so true. It is a perfect and humorous portrayal of different families.",204
2,"My children 5 and 3 love this series. They are so excited to hear what happens next in Jack and Annie's adventure. The book is simple enough for young listeners to follow along. However, be prepared to add your OWN drama with voice intonations and expression. We truly enjoyed Dinosaurs Before Dark so much that we have bought the next 2 books in the series. Also, check out the research companions for each book. This has brought non-fiction excitement into our read alouds as well.",483
2,purchased this unit and it work well. It is quiet and easy to clean. It has a 110 ac plug-in unlike the FIVE STAR FS8088 Ionic Air Purifier Pro Ionizer Cleaner with UV that uses a power pack. It also has a low setting that will turn the unit on and off in 25 sec intervals.,273
2,My son enjoys the Dinosaur Train adventures and loves learning about dinosaurs at the same time. This cartoon is not annoying to adults either.,143
2,"My baby loves this gym. The bright colors really attract his attention. The blanket is really great for ""tummy time"""", also. We registered for this one, not really knowing how it compared with the others. I'm glad we did. It's well worth the money.",248
2,"I use this product with my 15"" MacBook Pro. After reading review about laptops falling off lower priced stands I decided to shell out the extra cash and purchase this one and I couldn't be happier with it. It's a perfect height, feels very solid and helps keep my cables organized with the hole in the back. The little rubber bumpers keep your laptop from getting scratched while on the stand. I really have nothing negative to say.",432
2,This gizmo works pretty good for simple hole drilling in round stock. It is a bit flimzy and not for precise holes.,115
2,"Gritty, tough and rough. It may take a while to get in the saddle, but once you're there, you don't give up until you have taken the entire ride with these unforgettable characters. Not everyone will appreciate the reality expressed --- the corruption of the young country is revealed in a stark portrayal. But, it's a fine read, and the images don't fade fast from your memory. It reminds us of the struggle to be born...and to morph into something finer. We are left waiting for the next chapter.",498
2,"this is one of the best melvins album ever..from the start of boris till the end of cow,,,BY THE WAY THIS IS GRUNGE NOT METAL...youll get hooked onto this album more after each listening",186
2,This book was recommended by my son's drum teacher and they use it often in his lessons. My son is a young teen and is happy with the song selections in this book.,163
2,"Tye and Mary are delightful characters--very likable, feisty and well suited to each other--in this very fun and fast-paced Regency romance. The warmth, wit and lust for life characteristic of all Cathy Maxwell romances is evident here and makes this winning novel a charming read.",281
2,"I read this years ago, but the characters are still very clear to me.The story line of friends and falling in love is classic, but EDJ has a way of making you one with them. This book will make you laugh and cry at the same time.",229
2,"This movie was very funny. Some men could learn something from this...just watch, laugh and enjoy.",98
2,"Warmth, humanity, fun.It had been a bad day when I heard these wonderful songs again for the first time in ages. Then life smiled again.For your personal wellbeing, own them!",174
2,"This book is about Nancy Drew who was taking a vacation at Phonix, Arizona and has a to solve the mystery of Shadow Ranch. This book has a little of everything. It has mystery, adventure, romance, and much more.I really enjoyed reading this book by Carolyn Keene, she's one of my favorite writers. I give this book five stars. Hope you enjoy it.By: Lina",353
2,This book was really good from the start. It gave me new insights about myself and about the opposite sex. I would say it is a must have for any relationship. It can help make things work or make things work better.,215
2,Clever little unit and well worth the expense. I will be using it for travel and since I travel light it is perfect for what I will be using it for. It trims very efficiently and so far the battery life is good. Have not used attachments which appear adequate. Good value for money.,282
2,"I had low expectations for this book since so many Holmes pastches are uninspired ripoffs, but this turned out to be a clever and worthwhile surprise. There is a (mostly negligible) plot carried through the diary entries of Watson, but the real interest comes in the chronicled circumstances of the ""real"" cases behind the famous stories of the Canon, Watson's difficulties in pleasing his publisher and Holmes, and Holmes' ""true"" character and adventures. Well written and researched, and entirely ""plausible"" with respect to the Holmes cases.",544
2,"I never saw this in a theatre, but I bought the DVD right away because I enjoy this type of film. Well, I was more than entertained! The Special Effects are outstanding, sets and atmosphere are solid. Perhaps this is better seen at home...I don't know. I DO know that I was very entertained. Those who analyze stuff will not like it. To me, this was a composite of all the dumb stuff I enjoy watching to escape the drudgeries, etc. I'm glad to have this in my collection. It's so silly, and so much fun!",503
2,"Good pictures and good information. Useful as a book to show clients a picture of plants in a plan. Could use a consistent, easy to find section on the plant requirements. As a reference for designing this would help in finding appropriate plants for the project at hand.",271
2,Downton Abbey makes me proud to be British- we can certainly do great period dramas..and the acting is first class.,115
2,The entertainament quality is above the average of the series SG1. I think this film reached the quality level of Stargate Atlantis.,132
2,Fantastic! The original series was much better than the movies with Tom Cruise. I would recommend it to anyone who love adventure and spy movies. I am thoroughly enjoying all of these episodes.,193
2,"Perhaps the surprise album of the year. Paul Anka takes some of the most popular rock songs of the past few years, the arranger takes these songs down to the basest level and totally redoes them, a huge studio orchestra is added and viola you have a very very good album. Certainly not your typical Paul Anka fare. Note the reference to Frank Sinatra on 'It's My Life' to Pauls' penned 'My Way'. Outstanding are Bon Jovis' 'Jump' and Eric Claptons' 'Tears In Heaven' but the whole album is worth buying.",503
2,"I bought this product initially as a gift, and the first couple I bought were great... I think I've purchased 12 total... 3 of the units had some difficulty in holding a charge or turning on...BUT... when I called customer service, they were fantastic, and they sent replacement units that work fabulous. They are perfect for grandparents... etc..I even kept one for myself. Definitely worth the $$$!!!",402
2,"Henry Kuttner was a master of thoughtful, humorous and bitter scifi. He was so prolific that he used at least 5 pen names, including Lewis Padgett. My all time favorite story is ""Mimsy Were The Borogroves"". If that story doesn't give you shudders, then you are no longer alive. His stuff was well written, well plotted and wonderfully presented. If you have never read Kuttner, I envy you. Reading him for the first time is an amazing experience. Please get this book, in whatever form you can.",494
2,"Great for all my cassettes, and I love having the TV channels along with the radio. I just wish the digital functions were a lot easier to use for the radio stations. It would be much quicker using an old-fashioned dial for the radio.",234
2,"A very good transaction, handled in a timely manner. I am very pleased with the service that I received from amazon.",116
2,"From the first meeting, the earl gets it wrong. But he still knows he is right and he knows what is best for everyone, or does he? Barbara Metzger is at her best in this novel in creating a good story laced with sufficient humor to satisfy her many fans. This is probably my favorite of all her books.",301
2,After reading this as a library book I wanted it in my personal library. A Japanese garden is not my goal - a serene and calm landscape is. I found inspiration and sound principles to work with in ZEN IN MY GARDEN. A pleasure to read.,234
2,Works as advertised. Different charge indicator lights than older chargers. Hopefully it won't be as sensitive to power surges.,127
2,"Every teeny-bopper band for kids like us has matured. They found their own style and their own type of music. N'Sync is also maturing. However, we love them more than ever.",172
2,I have had the pleasure to work with Mr. Malloy at several Junior Olympic camps in Florida. His insatiable desire to learn everything about shooting is cheerfully expressed in his work. His book covers critical aspects of shooting that would help every experience level. The book is concise and easy to read with photos and illustrations to help the reader. His friendly style is a bright contrast to the typical egotism developed by shooting authors.The book is highly recommended by a former Junior Olympic shotgun coach.,523
2,"I watched this at my brother's house. It is a masterpiece of the genre and truly is Bill Shatner's greatest work. It will live on in this special edition.Tiffany Bolling was the perfect match for Bill in this epic. The sexual chemistry between them sizzles, especially when the spiders are in the scene. Should I be with this beautiful woman, or defeat the spiders, win her love and then be with her? Bill knows she likes him and keeps putting it off, however.",460
2,This is a VERY good CD Single by Ashlee Simpson!! I think is great that she is stepping out of all her sisters pop music and singing Rockish music. She has a very unique voice. Her new Cd is GREAT!!!!!! It is even better than this one. If you want to listen to it before it comes out u can on MTV and MTV. com. Every body should listen to this and buy her new great CD!!,370
2,"I had tried several different garage door seals. My floor is uneven & they would leave just enough of a gap in places, that allowed mice to get in, They would eventually get into the house & that's no fun. No mice this year.",224
2,"Rocco Facchini's MULDOON gives an interesting and concise history of the Catholic Church in Chicago, while accounting his eerie experiences with the ghost of Muldoon. It is an exciting tale that never failed to keep my attention. A must-read for lovers of ghost stories and local history.",288
2,"We have three cats and one dog and although we love our hardwood floors (and our cats), it's been a constant battle to keep the pet hair cleaned from the wood. The Swiffer Sweeper Vac has won the battle for us! It easily picks up all the stray pet hair. I use an old toothbrush to clean off the filter and all the stray hair goes right into the trash. Love this product!",370
2,I love this show! I wish Tila would make another one. All of the deleted and bonus scenes you get is amazing!,109
2,All this photographs are made with big passion and it is a very big pleasure to look at them after all these years.,115
2,"This band certainly appears to be a reincarnation of the Alegre All Stars (it features most of the legendary musicians who were key players in the 1960s Allegre sessions). Featuring the late great sonero Chivirico Davila and Paquito Guzman on vocals with a killer rhythm section this is smokin' classic ""Salsa Dura"" at its glorious best. Buy this CD now if you are a fan of 1960s and '70s Salsa. You'll love it!!!",413
2,Recently read it on a recommendation. Easy to picture the action in your head. Authors showed great choice of words and actions to get message across. Surprise Ending.,167
2,"~Well I have had this album since 97' when it was released and I fell in love with it instantly. It has a sexy up-beat style just perfect enough for a luxurious bubble bath, you know champagne, candles, and all alone. Relaxing music like this is sure to give everyday its calming nature.~",288
2,Awesome! Patty McCormack at her best. Everyone I suggest this movie to thinks it is the best movie they ever saw.,113
2,"I highly recommend Ms. Sprenger's book. I want to invite her to speak at an education conference but am having difficultly locating her. If any one has information about how I can reach her, I would appreciate it. Even a clue, like what state or city does she reside in, would be very helpful. Of course an e-amil address is preferable.",336
2,"I do not normally write reviews, but I don't want anyone basing their buying decisions on a reviewer who insists that a band stay within certain musical boundries. True, this disk shows some new directions, but it still exposes its roots. This is one fine recording from start to finish. Whether it pulls from rock, R&B or a little British pop, it still makes me want to hop in the car and head south. ""Yeah, I'll take a Catfish Po-Boy and an Abita Amber""",455
2,Very happy with this purchase. This is the second watch ordered over the last several years. I got this for my daughter and she didn't want another kind of watch...just this one! She is happy that we found it on Amazon!,219
2,A very human portrait of two legends - and incredibly well acted. I always love Michelle Williams and she really transforms to become Marilyn Monroe in this film.,162
2,"This book is just the best that weight watchers has put out, as it does work. Meals are tasty and filling. A must for serious dieting!",134
2,I have tried many brands of coffee over the years and this is comparable to much more expensive coffee. With subscribe and save this coffee is an unbelievable value. I have had two visitors over the last few months tell me this is the best coffee they have EVER had and I would agree.,284
2,"I bought this angled gauge along w/ a regular (flat) guage to adjust the valve gap on my ATV. Much to my dismay the thinnest was thicker than the gap spec, so it turned out to be useless. I kept it because it is otherwise a quality gauge. The regular gage had the thicknesses needed, so I'm glad I bought both.",310
2,"Somebody at Amazon is playin' tricks on my mind! I haven't heard this CD, but I'm a little bit annoyed that, when I'm searching for Karajan's version(s), this one comes up. David Hurwitz, an Amazon reviewer, doesn't like Karajan that much, so I wonder if he rigged it to go to this version. Oh well--the DG ""Originals"" series is so great, I'm sure this version is one of the best. But I wish Amazon would just let me search for the music without second-guessing my tastes. I want KARAJAN, so give me KARAJAN!",508
2,"I've read a lot of these kind of books and I found this one to be the best so far. He tells it like it happened and if he took a beating he told you so.Some of these type of books get a bit repetative . . . "" we charged into them and they ran"" etc.etc. . . this book wasn't like that.It was humorous at times, as expected cos he's from Liverpool and we all know they have a great sense of humor.It was a great read and i look forward to more stuff from Andy Nicholls.",467
2,"These are really nice, but I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because they aren't perfect for the price/quality. Nice size, but the proportions are a little off. We have tons of Marquis by Waterford and LOVE all the stemware. These are nice because they go with the set. I highly recommend them for water and have heard the actual water glasses break very easily.",355
2,"A lovely book. I, however, was not all that interested in it. I have never really cared for the history mystery genre. The ending was a nice touch though.",154
2,"This was a one of the better books in the Jedi Apprentice series. It shows lots of Obi-Wan's thoughts and how he works. You can pass on this book if that is what your heart desires, but people who want to really get into the Jedi Apprentice's, should definetly read this one. It has minimal action, but plenty of suspense you keep you reading.",343
2,"I love the walking dead series and this book is a great introduction of the main characters. It sets the tone for the rest of the series. Everything is in black and white, but the art is wonderful. The story draws you in. It makes you think what it would be like if you suddenly awoke in a world full of zombies.",312
2,Jenna Reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish. This young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording. Stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard. Fiddle playing of the highest order,298
2,"This was a good product, nicely packaged still in its original wrapper. I would recommend this movie to any car guy or anyone interested in how Enzo Ferrari went from racer to owning the biggest sports car company in the world. It is a long movie so make sure you have an afternoon off to watch the whole thing.",311
2,Can't wait for Season 2 to be available on DVD or Download.The first season is high quality television.,103
2,"This album's quite good, and the best tracks are 2,4,6,8,9,10, and also that remix of track 4 on #12. Everybody's just better sounding in rhymes and beats than their solos, even though their solos are hella tight, too.",218
2,A great read for those against the grain. I learned a lot of info. I recommend anyone that's into the lifestyle to read.,120
2,"I thouroughly enjoyed reading an advance copy of Ms. Berg's latest book and am happily anticipating her next one! The research and Montana setting, plus the adventurous hero Duncan Kincaid, remind me of an Indiana Jones adventure, but with more fun, and the added spice of romance. This is a change of pace from her other books, but still a fast and exciting experience!",370
2,"I bought this CD for my daughter, and ended up taking it back from her. After listening to it several times, I thought as a song writer, this is what I'd write, but Jennifer's talent brings it all to the top, she's so in the pocket, great layers, melodies, and most of all it gets your spirit moving! Great work from a new artist! I'm looking forward to her new work.",367
2,"I used this video tape to practice and learn Bruce Lee style of fighting. Actually doing it over and over while watching the video helped me master some of the good techniques. By the way, I have intermediate skills in marcial arts and found this video to be helpful..",268
2,"Nothing bad to say here - I love this perfume. As my daughter-in-law said, this fragrance is you, my grandson says oooh you smell good.",135
2,"This is a movie I was skeptical about buying because I so enjoyed the Jason Bourne Trilogy with Matt Damon. What I liked is that it was not Jason Bourne, but was about another member of Treadstone . I also liked how it was tied in to the other movies. Not as gritty and intense as the other three movies, but it did offer plenty of action and a good story line. Jeremy Renner did a good job with his part and I can easily see this continuing forward into additional movies...",475
2,Great book. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone that is interested in the Hell's Angels MC. But it!,113
2,This book is without doubt the most constructive advice any writer could ever receive. I have recommended it to every writer I know.,132
2,"I liked this book a lot but I thought it was very violent like when the teenagers were hacking each other to death with hatchets and I didn't like the fact that Robin Fear kills all the people for like no reason at all. Well,if you like Horrer then you will most likely like it. Hope this helps!",295
2,"A wonderful film with a star performance by actor Christian Slater(Heathers, True Romance, Soldiers Of Fortune, etc) as well as his co-stars. A real thrill ride! Would recommend for anyone seeking a film with plenty of on the edge of your seat moments.",252
2,"I thought the book was very well written. But after reading it several times I still had some trouble understanding it. If anyone could e-mail me, helping me to understand parts of it better, that would be wonderful!!! Please write back soon!",242
2,Bought this for my grandaughter who is a music teacher and also getting married. She really loved this gift! It is very nicely done and there is a CD fo the music in the book.,175
2,"Love this game, as it is so much fun to play, but it also teaches children how to count & mulitply!!! I would say it is a super buy!!",133
2,"An excellent book for the general reader not familiar with the subject. Learning to recognize situations and ""name"" them is a very powerful tool.",145
2,The only thing wrong with this CD is that there are too few selections. Danny O'Flaherty is the best Celtic singer I've ever heard. This collection is an absolute must. You will never tire of this music.,203
2,"Very good quality and can hold my mountain bike which is quite heavy. Easily installed. Perhaps one thing that need to be considered when installing this rack is the height. It is rather high for me and mounting the bike can be quite difficult and not to mention the possible staining on the walls. Other than that, it is really good!",334
2,"If you are concerned with the re-usability of plastic water bottles and are unsure what to buy, then this product is for you. If, like me, you are concerned with the durability of just about any item; this product is for you. The only reason it doesn't have a five-star rating is because it is not dishwasher safe and it is suggested that putting the Klean Kanteen in a refrigerator is a bad idea. Fill it up twice and you have your daily dose of H20.",451
2,"As far as textbooks go, this has to be one of the best that I have come across...and I have come across quite a few. The material is divided into closely related sections, and the text is clear and to the point in its explanation. Not much filler text or needless material. The diagrams are pretty clear and well positioned in the sections also.",345
2,"I have a lot of digestive problems, unless I take enzymes. This item is even better though, because it includes lots of other stuff that helps my stomach but previously had to take separate supplement for, or in a tea, etc. based upon my own personal experience, I highly recommend this product to anyone that needs help with proper digestion. I am not a doctor, but my doctor recommended I don't stop taking enzymes, but then I found this item instead of only the basic enzyme items, and I love it.",499
2,"this record is an AWESOME mix. the beats are loud, pumpin and get you movin. i totally recommend this to any club-goer.",119
2,It's really amazing product at the lowest price with all the features..till now wi have not notices any issues with product..hope it works fine in the future too..:-),166
2,"I bought a copy of this book at a used book sale over 20 years ago, and still have it. It's a piece of living fiction...it's a brave book for its time, talking of past lives and being fully believable at the same time. If you can find it, READ THIS BOOK!!",255
2,"This by far is my favorite Stephen King read to date. I've only read a few of his books, but this one kept me glued to the pages, wondering what would happen next. Probably helped that I'd seen the movie before reading this, but I absolutely enjoyed every page.",261
2,"Reading 10 Minute Marketer's Secret Formula was a terrific exercise in helping me address the marketing needs of my business. The subject matter provides an effective, economic solutions to sales challanges we all face.",219
2,my rate of this item is great!! fantastic!! couldnt complain about dc comics!!! cartoons bringin our favorite heroes to life!!!! 5 stars!!!,139
2,Interesting concept of the dog's perspective. Makes it seem possible. Still had historical information. Easy and pleasant read. Enjoyed it.,139

2,Exellent blade. Thin and long lasting. Kind of pricey but WORTH IT!! Avanti is my favorite blade. Have used them for years...,125
2,It's amazing how JK can keep rolling out such good ones. I'm well into adulthood and still fall in love with every Potter book. Book six sits proudly on my shelf and hasn't been snatched off by my covetous roommate just yet.,224
2,It is refreshing to read a bood that actually tackles women's health problems which really are not taken seriously. Too many women suffer and at this time the medical establishment should take a more serious and alternate view on how to research and help women suffering with PMDD. This book has been an immense help and many kudos to Ms. Dell for tackling this subject.,370
2,"I haven't listened to this album so writing a review would be an injustice to my man PETE ROCK (PRODUCER EXTRAORDINAIRE).Many cats have said though that the album is weak,yo don't blame Pete son blame the WACK ERA we are in right now b/c it's very contagious so I wouldn't be surprise if Pete album is weak Word.P.S WORD OF ADVISE DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON ANY OF THE LATEST HIP HOP RELEASES GO RETRO SON I STILL LISTEN TO HIP HOP LIKE IT'S 93.",444

2,I thought the war of the worlds was an ok book the thing's i didnt like about it was that in alot of parts in the book it dragged on and on like they just kept on running and running from the martians from mar's.Thing's i enjoyed about the book were it was cool about them breathing fire on the people at where the cylinder first fell.I also liked the times when the martians started destroying everything but it dragged on alot.Ialso enjoyed when the army came and tried to shoot down the martians but nothing happend.,519

2,"thicker than I thought, if you live in a cold place it's pretty good as a warm jacket at low price.",99
2,"I'd seen Rod sing some of these songs on a few variety shows when he was hyping this new CD, and was impressed enough to buy it. His voice really lends itself to these old standards, and just his rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight"" is worth the price of the CD. While this is not the rockin' Rod we all know and love, it really is some of his best work. So, my advice would be to just buy it, put it on, and hit ""Repeat.""",425
2,"Although season 6 of the X-files provided many laughs and entertaining episodes, it is not the series finest. The move from Vancouver to L.A. gave the X-files a sort of phony look. When the show was in Vancouver it always had a sort of creepy look to it, but in L.A. it just looked like all other shows. But it still remains to me the best shows ever created. And season 6th is definetly an excellent addition to any collection.",428
2,"Really good! Looking forward to many more seasons asap!...I don't know why US tv can't produce the quality of tv programming that the UK turns out!...of course,being born and bred in England maybe I'm a bit biased!,but my US husband is sick of the rubbish on tv now as well!!!THANK YOU Amazon for having such good programming available on 'Prime'!",347
2,"Well, I can't say anything less than great about the book because every page was useful. I read and reread the book several times to appreciate all of it since you get so much information without any thats garbage which is what most books contain when they are as thick as this one. The recipes I already had a chance to try to make were a success. This is only my 8th book in the culinary field so I am no expert but if my word means anything- i say get this book and learn A LOT!",481

2,"I was a little put off by the Barbara K logo, but it had what I was looking for. I wanted an ""upstairs"" screwdriver, one to keep in a drawer for little repairs upstairs without having to go to the well-stocked workshop in my basement. This isn't a girlie-man tool, it's a solid, journeyman screwdriver. Magnetic bits of enough sizes and a light that either shines where you're pointing the tool or detaches. The only thing more I would have liked for this type of tool would have been a ratcheting mechanism.",508

2,"This book is an excellent reference for everyone from the casual tourist to the prospective employee, who may not know much about this amazing country and its customs. Swallow's book is informative, humorous, and comprehensive, and I strongly recommend it to anyone traveling to Finland.",287
2,"I used to listen to this particular album when I was in highschool back in the middle 70s. I always thought Rod's bluesy honky tonk stuff on this album was some of his best stuff: ""The Balltrap"", ""Big Bayou"", and ""Wild Side of Life."" I bought the CD just to listen to those three songs again. Also, ""The First Cut is the Deepest"" was always another favorite in high school. I'm sure this was Sheryl Crow's inspiration too. Her version sonds almost the same note for note. Good stuff!",483
2,"Our four- and six-year-olds adored this book and asked us to read it over and over--which was difficult for me, as it kept making me cry. The artwork in this book is just beautiful, and the story of Simon and his loving family is very sweet. One ""real-life"" caution, however--I hope this book doesn't necessarily inspire families (particularly urged by their children) to get kittens for their aging cats, because it doesn't always work out as nicely as it did for Simon.",471
2,"This was purchased to go on a fire department brush truck to replace several other, often cheaper, winches that had been broken, including a Ramsay. After two years, this winch has been used and abused and has came through with flying colors, never failing to pull out whatever was stuck.Don't fall for cheaper products. Invest in a good winch and never have to worry...",370
2,"If you buy this like I did, plan on the expense of map downloading and replacing the power source in about one year.",116
2,"An amazing book on the how pulmonary physiology really works. Extremely detailed and the ever so important quick read. You will not have to get another book concerning this topic. I may be a little biased as Levitzky was a professor at my school and I had first hand experience with him and his book. However, I was reassured when I saw 3 different Pulm/CC docs with his book on their shelf.",391
2,"Purchased as a christmas present. Great value for the price, way better than the stores in my area had for pricing.",115
2,I enjoyed this book. I like reading Suzanne Brockmann's books. I was not impressed that the cover had changed and I purchased this book twice.,142
2,"As said, this movie definitely is my favorite of all time! The true story of the botched 1993 U.S. raid in Somalia that turned from a military mission to a hasty rescue operation was a very inspirational film as the pointless objective of those soldiers immediately turned into an incentive to get their brethren out of the clutches of the troubled city of Mogadishu. Ridley Scott's amazing visual attention and Jerry Bruckheimer's unstoppable action filmmaking truly account this classic as not only the best war movie ever made, but the best movie in general.",561
2,"Unlike the reviews below, this feeder has given us excellent service. I purchased this for my Mother to use. Her backyard is Squirrel Central and she is always on the lookout for a feeder for feathered critters, not furry ones.This feeder is very easy to fill and to date no squirrels has been observed successfully getting any seed out of it. Which isn't to say they don't try, but so far their schemes have failed them. The saga continues....",444
2,"My 11 year old grandson and I watched this movie together. He is adamant lately about not watching ""baby"" movies but he agreed to watch it with me and we BOTH enjoyed it soo much!",179
2,The ease of use is perfect for beginners like me. I have a few books on this subject and i would recommend it to others. Good recipes,133
2,"What a delightful book! This gem is perfect for the first time, or any time Mom who might need solutions to infant dilemmas. Menna has cleverly captured real Mom solutions to many every day problems and presented them in an enjoyable question and answer format. The material presented can be surprising and unusual to some, but I've tried many of the tips and can say that they truly work--and it is as entertaining as it is helpful!",433
2,"This has been a favorite of mine and my friends for years. Being of the ""Today"" generation, we're a group by ourselves at our school, but a group that is attracting more and more fans each year. It's just FUN to sit around and quote them, especially from this movie. When we see a cute guy, we say ""Ay, look a'that!"" or if we're at someones house, their father will allow us to say ""Oo's that li'l old man?"". Why not just have fun? The movie is fab!",449
2,"this audiobook is a good. i was looking for a good audiobook where where i can relax and listen to. well, i found it. a very good renbition of the hobbit. buy it",161

It's good quality and interesting to watch.Dave and Mary Mahre-RIP.",333
2,"I am glad to know the previous customer said the picture is misleading. The picture displayed are for the S and Tr model laptops. I wasn't going to purchase this item because there seemed to be ambiguity. (The A series power adapter is very different looking, and has very different power specs).",296
2,Product was exactly as decribed!! Came in on time. Also so much cheaper than buying it from th stores!! I am very happy with this purchase!!,140
2,This is a great CD and Ms. Lennox's voice is perfect. Don't even hesitate another minute and buy this CD!,105
2,I loved it. This is my second time reading it and I thought it was great. Loved Dallie - the overbearing jerk. Ms Fancy Pants - what a girl - dusted herself off and got on with life. Please read this book. It is so much more than any of the one star reviews. OK it may be an oldie but I don't think it is at all dated. She even made the golf seem interesting - I was on the edge of my seat at the Classic!!,406
2,"Does anyone else have this problem? I have seen most of the David Suchet Poirot DVD's but would gladly buy those I have someone missed. My problem is that when the sets are advertised, there is no desccription of which episodes are in the set. I am therefore reluctant to order a set inasmuch as the set I order may contain most if not all of the episodes I have already seen. Does anyone else have this problem in ordering, and if so, how to you deal with it? (Sometimes I can glean the title of the episodes included from the reviews, but not always)",552
2,"Mos Def's music is an example of where Hip-Hop should be heading. I have battled the options of settling for music that disrespects and exploits my womahood and my people, waiting for artists like Mos Def, Common, the Roots, Dead Prez and De La Soul to blow up. It just isn't happening quick enough. If you still have faith in Hip-hop, and you don't have this album, catch up to speed and support those that truly represent this culture.",437
2,"My wife purchased a copy this book for me last year. I have used the information to help me lower my average score 8 strokes so far this year.My son who is also just starting to get serious about golf and also a high handicap golfer, could not put my copy down. He is bigger and stronger than I am so it was difficult to my book back! I decided it would be a perfect birthday gift for him. He and I compare notes over the phone and in peson when he is in town. If you are a mid to high handicap golfer I don't think you could go wrong with this book.im",552
2,"Who is that coming online and hating on Olivia? Game is that you out there posting these things? Everyone knows how much Game likes to diss people, but in real life he's a little punk. Game is just a wanna be gangsta and a wanna be basketball player who got kicked out of college for being a dumba**. Game is the biggest wanna-be since Ja. And all of these little Game fans and WhackWall fans are just a bunch of losers who think they're cool just because they go against the majority opinion. Game's next album is going to flop, period.",537
2,"This is an extremely, extremely bright flashlight/spotlight. It will turn darkness into daylight. Its a tad heavy with 8C batteries. It comes with a spare bulb as well.",168

2,"I saw these 4 awsome guys at a Church camp. The music that they played really helped me get closer to God. Not only that, but they sing from their hearts. God really has blessed them. The best song that Lane wrote is ""Surrender to The Fire."" their music is the best I've ever heard. And I just can't get enough of it.",317

2,"This was exactly what I needed to reach an out of the way outlet and it works perfectly. I suppose $12 could be seen as expensive, but it seems to be of fairly high quality materials and is definitely sturdier than the typical extension cord. I'd definitely recommend this product.",281
2,"I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. This set is exactly what I expected. The quality of the wood is good and actually better quality than I woud have thought for the price. My husband had it put together in less than 1/2 hour. The first day she had it, she spent the entire day playing dress up and make up. Her dad said he had to pry her away from it to get her to eat lunch. I am very pleased with it and would recommend this product to anyone.",474
2,"I'll Put this in one word ""AWESOME"" these guys are great i first heard about them from a friend and they sounded good so i downloaded the song ""The Greastest Fall(Of All Time)"" and i liked it so i then downloaded the whole EP West Is For Wishing(i think thats what it's called) and thought it rocked so waited til' their CD Stories and Alibis came out and then bought it and the CD was just as good as the EP so i say congrats to this band with their CD and i hope they gain alot of fans and come out with many more CD's in the future",534
2,"Definitely one of his best ever. 'Shooting Star' is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard, Dylan brings 'All Along the Watchtower' with all the energy needed, and you can hear he still believes that 'The Times They Are A-Changing'. 'John Brown', like 'With God On Our Side', is a song against war, written in full Vietnam-period, but still aplicable today, and sung with sadness and anger. The only other song that truly stands out is 'Desolation Row', a beautiful ballad of nonsense that still makes sense.",522
2,"I love it when the series is all done, and I can burn through it without having to wait for the next book to be written. This was a very good book.",147
2,"The cake pan works allright except it waas sticking in a fewplaces. This may be because a recipe was not included in theorder so I used my own recipe.

There are some other similar products available too, but I purchased it based on its reviews I read and it works great.Would definitely recommend this product.",382
2,Fantastic game but the controles are preset and can not be reconfigured.I am used to configuring the controles a certain way and could not get used to this setup.I guess it is like the old saying ( You can't teach an old dog new tricks )I am a gamer and this is the first time I have seen this.Hope this is not the way of the future in games.But SIERRA comes up with a lot of weird stuff.,388
2,"This is my first electric shaver. I have shaved using disposable razors for years, and I was reluctant to switch because I had tried a cheap electric shaver and found it very uncomfortable. I was very pleased with this shaver. Not quite as close a shave as I am used to, but much more convenient. One thing I was impressed with is that the first charge of the battery lasted at least 3 weeks with daily shaving.Update 1-26-2010: After 3 years, this shaver still runs 2-3 weeks on a charge with daily shaving.",508

2,"Dooly's novel, ""His Brother's Castoff"" is a pleasant read and has a great cast of characters that will keep you turning pages until the very end. But be warned: reading this novel will compel you to buy up all the author's other books in this series!",250
2,"This book is well written, for BUSINESS-MINDED readers. It is NOT for the layman, or personal use, but for BUSINESS use. I mis-understood that. It is not suitable for my personal needs, but would be VERY beneficial for the business owner. Good luck to you!",256
2,"I loved Johnny Hortons CD, his song are of courage, hirtoric battles in American history like The Bayyle of New Orleans in 1812, or the sinking of the mighty German Battleship, the Bismark. Songs telling a tale of a Civil War battle and Johnny Reb. We need more artist singing songs as he did!",293
2,"I loved About a Boy and really, really loved the sardonic wit of High Fidelity. About a Boy is much deeper but just as cynical. Maybe even more so. The characters are richly drawn and just complex enough to keep the reader wanting more. Good read, but best to take some time with this one. Not recommended for a summer beach read.",330
2,"Not PC humor of the 70s, still entertaining after all these years. Like a good suit, quality transcends the generations.",120
2,I could give a good revue of all of Karen Kingsbury books but this one was particularly touching. I am sure that all adoptiveparents have the fear that the child they are raising could be taken back someday by the birth parents. In this case thebirth father was a cruel and heartless man. The birth mother showed her generous love for her son by finding a wayto let the adoptive parents continue to have custody of the little boy.,430
2,"I am very happy with the book, its been very helpful to my tween. Its written and illustrated in a way that makes it easy for young girls to understand what is going on with their bodies.",187
2,I enjoyed getting this in such good condition at such a great price. It is going to make my games that much more exciting. Thanks,129
2,The book is very helpful for the novice photographer. It was an assigned book in a photography class I took for the summer. I thought it would be a ho-hum book but it was better than I thought. The book includes photo examples of exposures and setting which is very helpful. If you are just starting out this book should be just what you need. Even if you have been taking good pictures for sometime by pure luck you will be able to fine tune your skills with the help of this book.,482
2,"As an album, the jam Revelation filled one side of the LP, logging in at 16 or so minutes, and the other 6 songs were on the flip side. The extended jam missed the boat entirely, but the other 6 tunes are pure power pop heaven. For the most part, they rock harder than the tunes on Forever Changes. This would be a 5-star effort if it were not for Revelation. Some of Love's best tunes!",386
2,They came very quickly and Were packaged very well. I love them. They matched the other Dublin Crystal I have. Very Nice. I do recomend them.Ken Gore,149
2,"Ok, I'll admit it, I have a Gameboy of my own. 40-something mother of two, and I got one for myself so that I could play with my kids. They're great! We are all great Pokemon fans, which is how we got sucked into the whole Gameboy thing, and those are still our favorite games.The only drawback that I find with the thing is that it does need to be well-illuminated, otherwise you'll give yourself a migrane trying to see the tiny screen. But that aside, these babies are fun! My kids love them, I love mine, great fun all around. Go for it!",541
2,This book absolutely changed my life!!! ..... As I was reading it -- the Holy Spirit was ever present ....... and I was on my knees in reverent prayer to God at the end of the book. God reaches out to everyone in different ways - and this book was one of those ways for me. I was so touched and moved - that I bought copies for everyone in my Bible Study group. I cannot recommend this book enough.,398
2,"They're not just rolling balls for your cats to toss around. They've got little nubblies on the surface that the furkids love to touch and roll around.The seller is fast and friendly with their service.

2,"This game is good, but I think they could of let u pick up an enemy weapon(mostly I mean the chainsaw guy's chainsaw). I am also pretty sure they are making a 3rd one, cause the ending, I won't ruin it for u, makes like a half way point in it to me. It ... that u only get a gun,axe, and some spells, let's get some other weapons here c'mon!!! Other than that, it's much friekier, that the first game.(I mean the mansion lvl.) Bloodier, and much cooler fatality, now if u would excuse me, I gotta go actually do somthing today, besides being on the computer!!!",560
2,"This cd is definitely a winner. Shania's singing abilities really shine through. The music is so fun-you never get sick of it, and it's really fun to sing along to. This is also great music to dance to. It's got a fast beat and it's just plain fun! If you buy this cd, you won't regret it!",289

2,"I am not a huge fan of convenience foods so prefer to cook from scratch when possible. But sometimes when you're on the go, it is helpful to have a few items that you can throw together at a moment's notice. Of all the pre-packaged potato mixes, I think this one is the best. My kids love these Julienne Potatoes.",313

2,"These performances by the Suk Trio are considered by many to be the definitive versions of the Dvorak trios. The recording quality is absolutely wonderful (digitally remastered analog recordings from the late 70s). Packaging is attractive, notes are informative, and the price is amazing for this benchmark 2CD set. Don't pass this one up!",339
2,"This is a very interesting documentary on Natasha Makarova's return to Leningrad after having defected years earlier. While most of it will only interest die hard Makarova fans, the extended clip of ""Eugene Oneign"" at the Kirov will thrill all.",244
2,this was such a good movie! it was pretty funny in most of the whole movie and it has a bunch of behind the scenes stuff with the DVD. the actors really did a good job,167
2,"How can you not love the classic version of Disney's Pinocchio. The platinum edition has a bunch of extras and enhanced quality. It felt like I was 8years old again, and watching it in the movie theater. A must buy for any Disney animation fan.",244
2,The character in the movie wasn't quite as scary to me as in the book. Also the writer character in the movie wasn't as compelling as the book but over all the story is good and there is always a new twist just when you think you have it figured out.,250
2,"Love the saw. Smooth, well balanced and has more power than any other I've tried! Now about a month of work on re-construction work and I really think Hitachi did a great job....I'm sold on their engineering and user knowledge, so my next tool (miter) will be a Hitachi. (Nov 2010)",281
2,What a picture!!!!!!!when you watch a dvd on this baby...you will be in heaven!! I will be getting hdtv thru directv soon..and after that I may never go to the movie theater again..it is that good! The only problem i have is the set is in my bedroom and when i have it on late at nite and the volume is low i can hear the fan...but don't let that stop you from buying this t.v.,377
2,"These headphones are cute, durable and work well. I have them for my 3 year old and they have lasted over a year. They fit his little head well and have a volume control on them that he can use easily. I didn't rate ""fun"" or ""educational"" high because - well they are headphones! Fun and education depend on what you are using them for.",336
2,"After about an hour of installation time, my Toto S300 was ready for a test drive. The directions were easy to follow and any handy-person equipped with a wrench and screwdriver could manage the job. All plugged-in, Toto operated perfectly, with all the features listed and more (auto timer and energy saver for the heated seat was unexpected). The remote works beautifully, and is really self-explanatory.Spending a penny has never been so much fun....and paper free!",468

2,The Buns workout is the best out of all of the 8 minute work minute outs. It is hard at first but it is well worth the effort. The 8 minute strech is a great addition to the DVD.,178
2,Wow! Not sure what happened but I'm glad I bought this set when I did. I bought mine for $72 directly from Amazon.com. Now it appears that people are selling it here for $250.It's an excellent set for even non-trekkie's like myself. I grew up with these movies and with reruns of the TV show. Captain Kirk and James Bond (Roger Moore) were two of my earliest hero's in my pre-teen years.,387
2,Easy to make. I pack the powder in a shaker cup and add ice cold water when I get the munchies. Tasty and convenient!,117

2,"This is such a beautiful book, one of my daughter's favorites. I don't know what happened to our copy, but I thought I'd buy one for my granddaughter. Truly memorable, I probably haven't seen the book for 25 years and I still remember the title and the pictures. I'll have to pray for a reprint.",295
2,This item arrived intact and prior to promised date. Cannot comment on its content as it was a Christmas gift.,110
2,A great book. I loved the cars and guitars angle. The fact that Billy Gibons is involved in the design and execution of these cars and guitars is a testament to his creativity as an artist as well as a musician. The shots of the lovely ladies as artist inspiration is classic as well.,284
2,"i saw Gomex perform live touring with this album, and although I had never heard tracks from How We Operate I went right out and bought it. I think the best track is ""How We operate,"" by far. There is more energy packed into that one song than into most ""high energy"" albums. The diversity between songs just shows the wide range of musical abilities within this group. There is variation in style, composition, and musicality in this entire album. ""Hamoa beach"" and ""Tear your Love Apart"" are also amazing. This is a must-buy.",527
2,If you want to save money on batteries this is the way to go. After reading other reviews we had no problems. With four controller we are always ready.,151

2,"I love the book, but was discouraged that I paid $60 and the price tag on the book was around $24! I feel I have been hosed. I suppose I should have checked out the price of a new book first. A lesson learned the expensive way!",227
2,"I Have the version that is imported from australia, but I think all the cooking for pump-kin tracks are all the same,just different covers. This cd isnt that great really but the tracks that are good are worth four stars.",221
2,"Basil has done some great work but never has so much of his genius been enbodied in one single soundtrack that trancends the movie itself. The ""Civilisation"" piece was played at my Norse inspired wedding reception. Hardly historically acurate but who cares, it pumps with passion.",280
2,"Practical, trustworthy, real, encouraging are a few of the words that come to my mind after reading this nifty eBook. You will get a lot out of this. Stanford MBA in 65 pages: business models, math and madness. I am the CEO of Spillover.com and I say buy it, and apply it - we are!",281
2,"this product is very nice, but it caries a lot of weight and it can be a little loose, but still love it, it keeps the cereal crunchy though , so nothing to worry about",168
2,"I thought this book was extremely good. I enjoyed the characters, the setting, and the sensuality. I highly recommend this books to people who like strong historical romances.",175

2,"King's ""On Writing"" is a must for any fan of his work, but especially for those who are fans and wish to write themselves. King begins with a short memoir describing his youth and the events and experiences that led to his interest in writing. In another section he gives writing advice and even includes part of one of his own incomplete stories, followed by corrections, and explantions. He finally discusses he near-fatal accident on a stretch of road.""On Writing"" reads like a novel, is entertaining and enjoyable to read. Recommended.",539

2,"My four year old daughter adores this book. Already a huge fan of the classic Cinderella story, she found this book at the library and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase a copy for our own collection. The illustrations are bright, colorful and clever. The story is long enough to hold the interest of a child who is ready to move beyond single-sentence storytelling, yet not so long that it takes forever to finish the book (always a plus if you have a child that is always trying to negotiate for just one more book before bedtime).",535
2,"I've been listening to a lot besides jazz over the last 4 or 5 years. Praying that some radio station would catch on to all the stuff that's going on outside of the main stream. This disc was recommended by a friend and at the same time I heard the tune ""That Easy"" a while back on KCRW. She's got a great voice and the music is burnin cool.... I hope you enjoy this disc as much as I do",387

2,This was the best book I have ever read. Finding out both mine and my husband's love lanuages has been great. Everything was easy to follow and made so much sense. It has improved our marriage a ton and I think that every couple married or not should read this book. It was wonderful!!,285
2,"This is a unique recording by one of Ireland's most exciting instrumentalists. Most of the tracks feature uillean pipes at the forefront, with a few tunes on low whistle. Arty McGlynn offers sparse but very poignant accompaniment on acoustic guitar. Some tracks feature some well placed percussion as well. The tunes are a good mix of driving dance tunes and slow airs. The style is very accessible and likely to appeal to traditional music fans as well as the uninitiated. You cannot match the power of Paddy's pipes for inspiration, meloncholy and passion.",558

2,"I bought this book for my infant son, but my daughters wanted me to read it to them and they loved it. It's a great story to teach the character traits of Godly people and the illustrations are top notch. I recommend any parent of a 3-7 year old boy to consider this book. The scripture verses are a nice added benefit to back up the traits that are given reenforcing that God commands us to have those traits.",410
2,"My son got this truck as a birthday gift. He plays with it often, he likes to put his smaller cars in it and dump them out. The handle makes it easy for him to push it and dump it(sometimes see next part...) but problem is the back that lifts up to dump something out, clicks/locks down and it's too hard for him to open it back up so i keep having to do it for him...it can get annoying.",388

2,"I love this product! I used it on my pregnant belly after showering and NO STRETCH marks. I also use it on any dry skin, scrapes, feet, and plan to use it on my baby as well. It's a pure substance, right from the shea nut tree so there are no chemicals added or any funky substances. There is no moisturizer like it!!! I am not crazy about the smell but apparently you can add essential oils to it to change the smell. Haven't tried that yet.",442

2,"I agree with the other reviewers that, while Seventh Generation does not compare to Cottonelle and other ""cotton softness"" rolls re: the softness factor, this TP is more than adequately soft. You definitely make a slight sacrifice in this area, but Seventh Generation is still better than what you get in public rest rooms . . . and, you will be doing your part to help save the environement. I am definitely not a ""tree-hugger"" type, but I feel that, at least in this area, I can make a difference with Seventh Generation.",523

2,"This is a classic game for geeks of all ages. The advance rules are the kicker and I can remember hours spent wasting time with friends on this game. One in particular stayed up all night before his SATs. Another was an avid player, but could never win. The pieces, like any board game, were icing on the cake which makes up for a rather weak game system. Marx was right, its all about production--in the 25th Century...",420

2,"This is the best, most complete version of music from the Star Wars Trilogy you can get. It is written like it just came of the from the pen of the mighty John Williams himself. It is written for piano (even though it does not say it)and it is fairly advanced. I would say you should have been playing the piano for 3 to 4 years to be able to sit down and go through all the songs, I believe a less difficult version is available but I have not seen it a Amazon.com. This is MUST HAVE if you love the music from Star Wars, and who doesn't?",539

Again, the children can ""outsmart"" the leading man because as he is looking all over for the pigs, the children can see the pigs ""right there"".

2,The Brinkmann Pitmaster Deluxe barrel smoker is a great smoker... especially for the price. We use it for weekend barbeques on a regular basis... and it has held up like a champ. The offset firebox is key if you're interested using it as a smoker. Or you can convert the firebox into an additional grilling surface.The Brinkmann Pitmaster Deluxe is well worth the cost. It's a central part of every one of our bbq parties.,422

This is the first time I've had an all in one--copy, photo, scan and print, and the quality of all is excellent. Time will tell, but I'm optimistic! The ONLY reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I haven't had it long enough.",554

His donations are really unprecedented and you could say he has done more for education than any other American. I truely love this man.

2,The words of Ed Fowler are a welcome change from the ususal gobbledegook that is heard today. I would enjoy reading Ed's observations even if I weren't a knife collector. Part two of Mr. Fowlers life quest is a continuation of the first edition and there's nothing wrong with that. It's refreshing to have a craftsman divulge the discoveries that has resulted in what I think is the perfect working knife.,405

We chose other fabrics than what Rosemary suggests and the quilts turned out beautiful!",410

There's a studied quality to their music that might turn some folks off, but anyone who likes the mid-tempo tracks of Stereolab, for example, will likely enjoy this CD.Its a shame that the band seems to have broken up, but this is a great final CD for them if indeed this is the last we'll hear from them.",523

Jesperson's excuses and bragging are included in the narrative, which can be off-putting, but Olsen is simply doing his duty, giving the reader all available information about his subject.

The 15 foot length enables her to walk with the laptop and the attached audio cables means there's one less cable to have to locate.

2,"All these folks that say that this game is JUST like the N64 version must not have played the game at all. A lot of new levels, plus the new characters make this game awesome. Luigi is by far the best character in the game. My advice is to use Wario only when you have to. Awesome game.",286
2,"I enjoy this scent very much, only downfall is I tended to have to spray a little bit more on me than i usually do other colognes! Although given the great price I paid for the size of the bottle, it doesn't bother me as much it would an expensive smaller bottle of a different fragrance!",288
2,"I have read a lot of complain saying that this video game is for only for rich people who can spend thousands of dollars for one amazing computer, that is false.I have a dell laptop which has 250GB hard drive, 4GB Memory, Intel Centrino Duo, 256MB graphic card (not shared) and this video game runs perfectly....Now, yes, there is 1 issue I really do not like about this video game:1. FSX does not give you a lot of airplanes like FS2004, just few ones, which make the video game BORING, for this reason, I rated it with 3 start.",529
2,"This book is very thought provoking. I was hesitant tosay much but it has alot to say about poor/rich, educated/non-educated and how different people deal with life. It turned out to be very inspiring.",201
2,"Start at the beginning, answer each chapter as you go along, go back and do it again - you will pass the exam. It's great!",122
2,"I happened upon this gem of a book at my local library. Jut a few pages into I was hooked. John Parris visited the mountain people of Western Carolina, picking up charming stories, old knowledge and interesting history along the way. I read about things in this book that I would have never found otherwise. The book appears to have been written in the 1960s or early 1970s. You read of know-how from generations past that is becoming more and more scarce as time goes by. If you can find a copy of this book, it is well worth your time and money.",547
2,Excellent series so far. Let's hope Martin doesn't drag this out like Jordan's facial expression epic: WOT.,107
2,"It's a cheap upgrade for an old netbook. Of course, the old netbook's processor and video are so slow that it's almost not worth using anymore, but memory is so cheap, why not?",176
2,"I like this, it's a cute functional way to store my external hard drive. Also, its compact so it can basically go anywhere I need it to.",136
2,It took 2 days with standard shipping and was in excellent condition.,69
2,"Battlefield Of The Mind is an awe inspiring read, a profound study in new ways to positively redirect the minds path of processing life's difficulties. The read was awe inspiring and I carried it with me like a security blanket for weeks! There were days when a single paragraph built me up just enough to get through a moment, a day, a week. I would recommend the the devotional as well.",388
2,This is a great book for quilters at any experience level. The projects are small but useful. Debbie Mumm has many quick tips that make your projects come out looking like you have been quilting for years. This was my first experience with strip quilts and speed triangles. The instructions are clear and concise with diagrams to make it easy.,343
2,It you are a fan of Warehouse-13 you cannot on pass on Season 3 loaded with extras including the blooper reel. The interviews are really fun. The cast appears to really enjoy each other and working with each other. If I have 1 complaint it that it's only available on DVD and not High Definition Blu-ray so after reading this purchase it.,338
2,"Very reasonable price and sturdier than the original. Definitely suits my purpose. For an older product, it was easily available and was delivered as advertised.",161
2,I enjoyed this story and really liked the characters. It was an exciting adventure even though it's not one I'd ever want to go on myself. :-) I thought it was well written and the conversations flowed nicely and were believable.,229
2,"My best friend bought this mattress with his sofa sleeper. As I work overseas, I sleep for weeks on this mattress. It inflates in seconds and is the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. Other people simple don't believe it's an air mattress until I show them. I'm ordering one now for my new apartment overseas.The mattress is a lot cheaper from the company than from this website! And you can order just the bladder, not the whole spring system. Sounds like previous user may have had an operational error ?",519
2,"In my mind, ""Young Offender"" is about Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Narcissists (avoid them at all costs) have minds like computers, hence the computer-like and mechanical feel of the song. You leave this song feeling indifferent. Do I like it or do I not like it? That's exactly what narcissists are: indifferent. The lyrics and the music fit perfectly when thinking in this context. This song has helped me cope greatly when I determined that a good friend was indeed a narcissist. Brilliant song. Brilliant album.",521
2,OMG! I am a Glee addict! I had only caught a couple episodes on tv and liked it. But I aboslutely love this show! I wish I could break out in song and dance all day long. :),173
2,"WOW! She did her homework! It is all in here. Some startling insights and provocative thinking. After you read this one, you may rethink your reality. Perhaps we all need to read this to make sure we haven't overlooked some significant details! This should be in EVERY school, EVERY hospital, EVERY clinic, EVERY doctors office and every child protection agency office. If you suspect Abuse- get this book. You will gain valuable insight and will be able to see things you might otherwise have missed!",501
2,I found this book interesting. I think the author did a great job writing the mystery part.,91
2,Rewarded my daughter with stickers and she loved it actually bought another. It actually made her want to use the potty and after she did she always wanted to pick out a stcker,176
2,"Of course I'm a bit biased, being a hard-core Styx fan back in the day. But I remember this as being the one that I could listen to over and over. One of the better ""theme-theater"" albums of it's era, at least in my opinion. One of the better albums to move to CD, so you could finally listen to the flow of the whole thing without having to flip it over. (i.e. Dark Side of the Moon).",385
2,"This is a wonderful CD, you will not be disappointed at all by this young man and the talent that he is bringing. I purchased this CD before Donell even came out with his second CD. I love his remake of Stevie Wonder's ""Knocks Me Off My Feet"" but I truly enjoy all of the tracks off this CD. This CD is one of those Love Mellow, but yet upbeat type of CD's. If you are tired tasting the same old flavor and you are in search of something that will keep calling you back to listen over and over again. This is the CD to add to your collection.",542
2,this product allows you to turn a TV to almost any direction in a room. We have it mounted on the wall of our home office to allow viewing from the work area or from the relaxing area. It is well made and works great. if you are hesitant about installing then buy this and hire someone to install. just ensure you mount to studs and follow directions.,351
2,"Another great entry in the Hap/Leonard series, and this one comes with one of the best opening chapters of any book, ever.",122
2,"Folks, if you have never ready John Saul before, you will love this book. I have been reading all sorts of books for 30 plus years. This is hard to put down. I have not read any of John Saul's books before. Some of you say this is not that good. Well if that is so, the ones you think are good must be out of this world. This book makes me feel like I am there, part of the scene. So refreshing to read something original (for me) and very very well written!!",459
2,My wife and I decided to get rid of cable and go with Netflix and Hulu but we needed an antenna so we could still watch the local channels. This one was cheap and it works great. It was shipped super fast too.,209
2,"I don't like a kind of philosophy-book very much. That's because that kind books is not practical but emphasizing obsolete way of life.However as soon as I opend this book 'hungry spirit'by chance ,my fixed thinking as above have been all changed. 'hungry spirit' is so practical and helpful for the pragmatist like me.I dare to recommend it to you. Once you begin to read, you will know the reason why...........",413
2,I have read this book twice. It really helps in understanding the different personality types and the way they think and communicate. A great read for even the work environment. I highly recommend it.,200
2,"This DVD is childish, in poor taste, and I love it. Triumph the insult comic dog is hilarious. From picking on American Idol contestants to assuring Star Wars neirds they will never lose their virginity this is a favorite in my household.",238
2,"I purhased this from Wall Mart for $143. It's whisper quiet - even on ""high"". However, there seems to be a faint smell of bleach instead of the fresh air I expected. I purchased it based on ease of cleaning & square footage covered (500) & moderate pricing.",257
2,"This is a good album with a country/blues/folk mix. The songs are unique and tell stories. A few songs are a bit slow, but appropriate to the type of music. Robin makes the songs her own. This album is definitely not generic and is worth a listen.",247
2,"I make my own enchilada sauce usually, but if I'm pressed for time I go with the El Pato. For a canned sauce, it's pretty darn good.",132
2,My Grandmother gave this cookbook as a gift to my Mother and I. My Mother lost hers and can't live without it. I purchased it from Amazon to replace her lost copy. So many good recipes. Many have become staples at family get togethers and for holidays. This is my favorite cookbook.,282
2,This movie was my favorite growing up. It's become a classic in my family as my daughter enjoys watching it as a young adult.,125
2,"I loved this movie and the soundtrack! The vocals are excellent and so are the lyrics. Most of the songs are super but I didn't like My Lovey Dovey baby. It is sooooooooooooooo annoying! but all the songs overide that icky track.My favorite songs are Seize the Day, Sante Fe, and The World Will Know.I reccomend this CD to anyone who loved the movie.",350
2,My favorite scent now rolls on! This version is very useful to travel and carry in your cosmetic bag. Love it!,110
2,My daughter loves it and has watched it over and over again. It's something even her older siblings will watch with her. ;),123
2,"Perhaps overly complex. The story jumps out and grabs you. The writing is quirky, but the sentences are almost poetic. The story is great -- I sped through 420 pages, but the last 30 left me wanting a re-write. See if you can make it through the book without getting distracted by the presence of the word ""angle"" in every chapter, and the descriptions of the quality of light.I can't wait for his next one!",407
2,"Excellent read. I can't remember the last time such a flawed hero captivated me. Result, I started the book at 2230 and finished at 0035...I was incapable of not reading the next page.",184
2,"here's a Movie from the past.i remember watching this way back in the days.i got it on dvd, and yea the movie is okay, but heather thomas looks great in the movie.",163
2,"I liked this album a lot when i first heard it but it got a little bit old. The album starts off with a really bad intro(probably the worst intro i've ever heard) and then goes into Not give a f*** my favourite song. Call Me, Can't Let You Go and sickalicious are all mad songs. But songs like damn and my life with a really bad guest appearance of mary j blige are bad. I would rather go out and get a brilliant cd like lil kim",428
2,"OK, I admit I rented it to see only Paul Gross from ""Due South"" but I was pleasantly surprised. Peter Burg (Berg?) from ""Chicago Hope"" plays 2nd fiddle and does it well. They work well together in this ""buddy"" film, despite some holes in the plot. I'm not a skier so found the length of some of the ""extreme skiing"" sequences tedious. But the scenery is gorgeously filmed. Overall, it has more actual plot than most Sat/Sun afternoon films on the tube.",452
2,"I was a little disappointed with the insulation with this bottle, as it seemed that it would make a big difference but it didn't. It extended the coolness of the water maybe 30 minutes. Construction is good though so all in all, not a bad bottle.",246
2,Bought this for use on my motorcycle. Dealer wants $1300 for essentially the same unit with Bluetooth (which I don't need) and their logo. This does the same thing at a fraction of the cost.,190
2,"I cannot describe how much I love this show. I was born in the 80's and watched reruns of it in the 90's, and no other show has touched me as much as the Wonder Years.Please, Please, Please bring to DVD!!! If not that, please put it back on reruns!!!",250
2,This is a great Video and a pleasure to watch such natural acting combined with the best of British humour,106
2,"These came exactly as described and were purchased for our 5 day anniversary cruise. The three smaller ones we had left empty and the three larger were filled with vodka, tequila, and whiskey. The pouring funnel is a nice touch and is really necessary to avoid spills. We went through security multiple times with no issues (initially to board the ship and then again when re-boarding after island excursions. The small ones are ideal for fitting in the back pocket of men's jeans. Shipping was quick and arrived exactly when expected.",535
2,It's very thin so when I first got it it seemed so fragile to me but I'm used to it now. It's easy to use and easy to learn how to use!,135
2,"Until I started reading this book, I had no idea the depth of the meanings behind the words spoken by Jesus in the Beatitudes. This book is well written, the author is speaking to you. I would think this would be absolute reading for any serious bible student.",260
2,"No more worry about garage closing on car or crashing into freezer. It sticks to floor wonderfully, stops the car when we come in at a slow roll and is so brightly colored Im not worried about tripping over it.",210
2,"Bough it for my Zen to use in my GM Tahoe. At first, it sounded muffled, so I turned off the SMART VOLUME and RESTRICT VOLUME in the Zen. I would give it 5 stars but the cord is super long and doesn't look so good, but it sounds great.",235
2,"Betty and Veronica are both wonderful dolls. Thank you for your fast service, and a great product, exactly as described. I love them!",133
2,"Nice big folding chair. Armrests are great! Love the drink holder. Not sure why the cooler is attached. Makes it so you can't fill it, then pack the chair to go. Could make cleaning it awkward. Very sturdy. Would love more support at top of back. Otherwise, nice chair.",269
2,"Couldn't find Hill have eyes at ANY store. For the price of one, you get both. I really only wanted the number 1 but to get both on blu- ray, GREAT!",148
2,"The album's sweet spot is the creamy, dreamy ""Transit of Venus."" Under the muse of love, Simpson sounds effortlessly and affectionately sexy. His soft-eyed, smokey sensuality hovers between heaven and bed, and flows between the two in unexpectedly charming ways.",262
2,"This is my new workhorse and the price is incredible! You can use it to fry, saute, boil-- make stews and then you can put it lock, stock & barrel into the oven. Thank you Caphalon and thank you Amazon!! I bought another Caphalon skillet at TJ Maxx about a year ago and it was in NO way as good quality as this one. Being a new Mum on a budget, I can really appreciate buying these quality cookware pieces one at a time. You won't regret adding this one to your collection!",473
2,"Best show in it's genre, be it Sci-fi, Drama, or adventure.It's premeire on DVD is long past due. Season One is the Best of Three. Blessed be to those that have past Jonathan Brandis and Royce D. Applegate, long life those who live on Roy Scheider, Stephanie Beacham, Don Franklin, Stacey Haiduk, etc.",301
2,"While I think the fan works well for the lost cost of the unit but I really wish I had just spent the extra money on a better unit. The power is okay but weaker than most square box fans. Also, not having a remote is really an inconvenience, especially since it does not have a sleep mode. If you want a good fan that's a real space saver and is inexpensive, I'd recommend the DY-012",383
2,Smells clean and cool! Love it! It's great because it's such a good smelling cologne that lasts long. It's legit too!,117
2,"For all intent and purpose, this is a Miles Davis record, and he shines. The first three tracks are the highlights. However, I was rather puzzled that Cannonball appears as the leader, since he is so obviously overshadowed by Miles. Still, a good album that is worth the price.",277
2,"I was not familiar with nina before this album. I definitley like her groove. Very powerful singer. A couple of tracks are a little hokey for my taste, but overall a great listen.",179
2,"Some say that Jewel's lyrics are simplistic and lack depth. Some recognise that underneath it all, the truth is simple. In ""Spirit"" (as well as ""Pieces Of You""), she is singing in the language of truth. As complex as life can be, the truth is always there. Like her namesake, Jewel shines quite brilliantly in her music. She sings from the heart... And within our hearts (or subconscious minds), are answers that most of us never dreamed we could find. In ""Spirit"", Jewel continues to stay true to her music, her fans, and her fathomless heart.",544
2,some of the cool session players in nashville. some of the jams are pretty ripping and some are just o.k.,105
2,"This product was half of what most retail stores charge. It is padded on the inside to protect a scope. This is a great case for carrying to and from the range or for storing in a closet or under the bed. I dont know that I would want to throw it behind the seat of my truck and forget about it, but it is definetly a nice quality soft case for an excellent price. Fits an m-4 with a 3-9 x 40 scope nicley and the 5 outter magazine pockets are a nice feature.",459
2,"Looks great, easy, productive mashing, ideal results, very easy to clean, and very sturdy.The round masher is less ideal, however, than an oval masher. Requires some stirring to get at potatoes next to edge of the pot (oval mashers better fit against larger inside curvature of pot). Harder to store than oval masher (does not fit in drawer).",342
2,This book is full of fun activities that can be used in my classroom. I would recommend this book to any Language Arts teacher!,127
2,"It's comfortable, and takes up less space! We even fit it in our gazebo! I never thought my husband would sit in it, but alas, he is the one that uses it most frequently. You can sit or lie down on it. It is very strong, and so easy to put together. I actually got it up in less than 10 minutes, maybe 5. And I am not mechanical! The only complaint I have is that my head is not that comfortable when lying down. A pillow would probably help.",442
2,"If you are looking for a box that is strong, and very secure do not get this one. The metal is strong enough and it serves its purpose for what i purchased it for, however the lock is easily opened, IE I opened it with a thumbtack in just a few seconds. Great for kids who like to think they have privacy, or if you just want to store away rainy day money in a simple box.",372
2,This is a GREAT book especially if you have spent as much time in Baja as I have. The recognizable history is fascinating.,122
2,"Charlotte Perkins Gilman is a little known woman, but certainly deserves her place in society and in the history of the women's movement.",137
2,"It's worth the price for ""The Question of U"" which is an unknown Prince song (check out the song sample). And I am totally in love with The Time's ""Love Machine."" The Time rocks, and so does Elisa (the girl they are singing with!)",230
2,"I am a co-writer of Bad Habits.Brian O'Shea and I wrote this song in 1997 for his album. but I got to tell ya Michael did really great job on the blues rocker with the best hook in a song. Take the time to listen, you'll love it.I so impressed with this album, it sounds so Nashville. It is Great!",297
2,its a cute little story but nothing to tell the world about. replay value is purely for the Felicia Day fans,108
2,"the jeans fit beautifully, and the color was exactly what we wanted. Only problem was that the legs were a tad too baggy, but we ordered ""regular"" instead of ""slim"" fit, so we are pleased.",188
2,Looks like something they would have at the W Hotel. I have a solution for the metal on metal problem -- they use it in retail stores... take a piece of wax paper and rub it along the rod -- it will slide great!!!,213
2,"As a craniosacral therapist, I am constantly on the lookout for music that does not interfere with a clients process and possibly enhances it. This album is exactly that. The music swims through the room as the artists dance together in simple and seemingly exquisite bliss. My clients love it and after I bought this album, I immediately bought it for my closest bodyworking friends.",384
2,"For many years I had listened to my mother's album of this concerto by Zino Francescatti, but decided to upgrade to a CD. I was concerned that no other version could measure up, but Anne Sophie Mutter had a dazzling interpretation and the NY Philharmonic complemented her nicely.Simply exquisite - a joy to savor with a nice glass of wine after a rough day's work!",364
2,"I bought this book for my 4 mo. old daughter and she loves it. She likes being able to grab at the pop ups and look at the vibrant colors. I actually found myself grabbing for this book to read to her. So, it didn't take me long to decide to get her the whole collection. Of course when you see something like this book that holds your childs interest you have to just go with it.",380
2,"I thought i bought it for my daughter and now i enjoy watching it as much as her. Very well made, witty, very funny, a great movie all around.",142
2,"We have used this product for over three years and it works great. No brown or dead spots in the lawn. Because we live in a snow area, we give this year-round so once the snow melts there are no lawn stains.",207
2,yo dis game is tough no b-ball game can beat this who kares about wat others think buy this Peace,97
2,"I believe this book is a must have for anyone who loves to play the drums. It has many detailed and interesting pictures and fasinating information about the early years of the drum set. Although, I also believe that it tends to be from a british point of view and does skip over a lot of what has happened with the drum set in more recent years, but it would be an enjoyable book for anyone who likes to sit down and play on their drumset!",440
2,Love the new subscribe and save feature on Amazon! Goji berries tend to be pricey since they come from and area around the Himalayas. Great quality at a great price!,165
2,"I thought that this book was one of the best. It had to do with a lot of horse facts and funny parts! Stevie was great and so were all of the characters of course (except Lisa shows that she has low self asteme. Without her her friends I don't know what she'd do!). I and my two friends have a club called the Stable Club (I'm 12). We love horses just like the saddle club. And we love to read saddle club books and even the new series by Bonnie Bryant; Pine Hollow. Any way, it was a great book! Write more of those good books Bonnie bryant.",542
2,"2006 and I'm still using this little beauty. Clean interface, great dictionary/thesaurus, and an indispensable style guide. A searchable quotation database and an adequate world map feature add to this haiku of a program.Microsoft dumped this in 2001 and replaced it with Encarta. Too bad. I wish they still made software like this...it does more with less.",357
2,"this record kicks so hard and the live record is even more intimate, the live dvd is so good and the visuals are amazing",120
2,After reading the reviews on this product I was unsure what type of experience I would have using this product with Linux. I'm running Ubuntu 9.10 and the touch pad worked right out of the box including the right click and scroll areas. From my usage it has been a solid touchpad that does what I wanted it to do.,313
2,"This game is excellent for children, educational and fun. The game is simplistic in that it offers straight up learning, without the frills of graphic laden game that detours more towards entertainment, than the basics. My kids choose this foremost over the contemporary learning systems, and they excel.",304
2,"We was given this book shortly after we adopted our son. It has great information and is written so anyone can understand it, not all clinical jargon. I have reread the book several times at different stages of our sons development. This book is a great resource and I highly recommend it to anyone living with a RAD child.",323
2,Great for an old cd. it came in quick and works great. the casing was not broken at all and the price was not bad.,114
2,"Works great, looks great, sings great, and is economical for a stainless steel product with quality hardware. What more can you ask?",132
2,"I bought this album after I saw the video for ""Only Love"" (great song), and I was certainly not disappointed. Though Toni does have a richer voice, I think Trina, Tamar, and Towanda hold their own very nicely. My favorites are ""Where's the Good in Goodbye?"", ""The Boss"", ""Only Love"", ""What Does It Take""...heck! I love the whole album. Why am I trying to choose my favorite tracks? They all rock! I hope they put together another album because I'll definitely buy it!",467
2,My friend had ranted about this movie and expressed that she would love to have her own copy. It made a great birthday present for her.,135
2,What an accurate album title! Beautiful relaxing selections. I highly recommend this CD if you like softer instrumental Christmas music.,136
2,"This was a textbook for one of my psychology classes and I found it to be exceptionally well-written. The interplay between raw scientific data and amusing tidbits of knowledge was well-balanced. This is a book that could be unbelievably tedious to read, but I found most chapters to be a joy. While a Memory and Cognition class can be fascinating it is often dull--but this book is anything but. Granted there's a bit of terminology that can bog you down at times, but I like a challenge when I read. This book is a keeper.",524
2,"This battery is priced very well, and currently I am using two in a fish sonar. I am fully satisfied.",101
2,"This coconut juice is the best I found, for your money.I drink one after my workouts, and on hot days, to cool myself down.",123
2,"This is such a great book and also a superb great one. He starts off going to the Underland to fulfill a prophecy ""The Prophecy of Bane"". He and his sister Boots go back because his sister gets stolen by the roaches. You should read Gregor the Overlander first so you understand. This is a great book, I couldn't stop laying eyes on it.",336
2,"We thought the remastered editions of Episodes IV-VI were fabulous! Not only were the films clearer and sharper than they ever were, the subtle additions of deleted scenes made the whole re-seeing all that much more spectacular. My husband and I saw the originals when they first hit the theaters over 27 years ago. It was great to see them restored so well. We especially loved the end of Eps. VI where Hayden C. was placed next to Yoda & Obi-Wan in spirit form. It just made the melding of Eps. I-III with IV-VI all the more complete.",536
2,My first time using external flash. I works great! Multiple angle for bounce is very good. It seems I never have enough cleaning kits. Good buy.,144
2,"Quite simply. It is important for men to retain their manliness. This movie influenced me 13 years ago and now, 13 years later I can appreciate why.",148
2,"This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the ""natural disaster"" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too",506
2,"I was pleased to stumble across this entertaining horror gem! I liked the fact that it didn't contain lots of in vogue gore which made a refreshing change from the majority of horror films of late. I'm sure it will not go down in history as a classic of the genre and perhaps I'd of given it 3 stars but for the great twist at the end, well worth the extra star! Worth a watch, there are worse movies than this, ""The Grudge"" for example!",437
2,"As a firefighter's wife, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. My husband did as well. We have been married for 14 years and agree that we wish we could have seen this together many years ago as we were struggling through many of the same obstacles. Not just for those in public safety though. A fine movie for all, no matter what stage of life they are currently in.",362
2,Co worker need this movie I just ordered it for her. She has not offered any complaints of the product.,103
2,"This cologne is the Sex Panther of Anchorman. It is absolutely incredible. It has a somewhat stinging first scent, but quickly fades into a rich mix of lavender and masculinity. As with all cologne, you should definitely find it in a store (Macy's or Dilliard's) and try it before you buy it, but you really need to try this.",325
2,"I love this leather chain~ it comes in different lengths and in brown, too. It looks great with big silver pendants and my turquoise pendants. They look great layered too~ just be very careful with the catch on it however, I've found it can break pretty easily. A stronger catch would be excellent but if you are careful with it, it's no problem. Great price for the value!",373
2,"This is one of the best shows on tv. We don't have cable, so I have to wait for the dvd's. However, it's nice to be able to watch them several in a row and without commercials!This season has a few flaws, but nothing major. It still keeps me on the edge of my seat. Personally, I love the character development episodes just as much as the action oriented ones.",361
2,"When I finished the book, I was glad I had read it. But it took a long time to read it as the first third seemed to just go on and on and on. The second third was o.k. reading. The last of the book was excellent and made it worth the time.It got mixed reviews from my friends....people seemed to either REALLY like it or really didn't....few inbetweens.",353
2,"I have bought kitchenAid factory-reconditioned appliances before and have always been happy with their quality and value. This burr grinder is no different. It works as promised, looks great, and has a heavy high quality feel to it. I'm pleased.",245
2,"WOW - just bought this DVD based on the Amazon reviews and I was impressed. She focuses on fast, practical foods for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and I thought everything looked good AND made me believe I could also do it, which is important. I wish she'd get a show on the Food Network.",288

2,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a exciting book continuing as number five in J.K Rowlings story. This book was so good that I could not put it down, In fact as crazy as this may seem i managed to read the whole 896 page book in one day-saturday the 22! I loved the new relationships in this book such as Harry and Cho Chang's. There is so much meaning in this book! A sad ending though. I cried just as Rowling did as well. I feel like the character was a part of me-in fact the character was my favorite too.",522
2,"This book is a hint that math can be both fun and useful. Understandable even to the non-mathematical reader, it tells in an entertaining style what mathematics is about and what it is good for. It shows how math helped us understand nature and our world in general, how it was used in mankind's most important inventions and developments; how it threaded through our history and what can we expect in the future. Both enlightening and enjoyable reading.",454
2,"Although my husband is the one who normally watched Xena during the 6 years while it was being produced, I did watch some of them.Of all the ones I saw, ""A Solstice Carol"" is my favorite. I laughed myself silly the first time I saw it and I laugh just as hard every time since. It is such a combination of holiday cliches that you just cannot help it. Even the ""little"" tribute to Hercules brings a laugh (if you recognize him).You have to watch it more than once. You're laughing so hard you're bound to miss some of the jokes the first time through.",551
2,"I first saw these ""chicks"" in a window at the Austin airport but didn't want the hassle of carry on. AMAZON---as usual had them and I was not disappointed. Always looking for colorful chicks to add to my colection and the worksmanship is beautiful as are the colors. Looking for more.",284
2,"I was afraid to put the book down. And the moment in the book where she jumped out of the window, my heart stopped. I'm like, no no this book should have a happy ending!! But anyway I would recommend this book to heartwarming lovers and thrill seekers.",252
2,"I love the dvd. My only complaint is that they messed this dvd up when transfering over. I saw DM twice last year and i have to say ... Martin Gore's voice is too low in the mix here. I mean extremely low. Dave Gahan's is fine but they screwed Gore on this. Pretty dissapointed with this. However, for anyone who didn't catch this live show- its a must. For those that did, its a nice reminder of how amazing these guys are live.",429
2,"I was a ""Franklinized"" person for years. The focus was great and all in one place. That was in the simple world of memo's and telephone messages. Seems like a century ago!It no longer worked in the multiple email, voicemail and some snail mail world. Things were sticking out all over. I needed a new system.Getting things done helped me re-focus again. I am learning (as it is a process) to reorganize both my thinking and organization. This will take time but with this easy to follow coaching tool, I will get there. Good Buy!",529
2,"The text is wonderful and informative. The reason I gave it a four star rating instead of five is that I would like to have seen the illustrations in color, but don't let that stop you from getting this great book. As stated by Patrick O'Brian in the Forward of this book ""You name it, Nelson's Navy has it.""",308
2,"Too bad it's out of print, but I've read that the author intends to update and reprint a new edition. Based on this edition, it should be worth getting. This edition covers fallacies and when to ignore them, pressing plans, and variations of the Mariner's Star, as well as basics on ironing (or rather pressing instead of ironing).",331
2,"By watching this movie, I feel I have been part of a Anime Film History.This film amazingly uses one of the most well known story in the world to describe one human's darkest struggle with his animal instinct and human emotion.A truely masterpiece scripted by the director of Ghost in the Shell and Patlabor 2: The Movie.",321
2,"Each time I read this book, I pick up previously missed ""words of wisdom"", and am transported along with him to all the adventures he describes so intimately, all over the world. Here is a man who went for his dreams, freely admits when he screwed up, and made it in a way we can only imagine. I absolutely loved this book.",323
2,"I bought a Leapster for my 3 1/2 year old daughter, because she always wants to play with her 6 yo brothers gameboy. She absolutely loves it. The only toy that can hold her attention for literally an hour. The downside is that once her brother saw it, he couldn't put it down. Bummer for her. We bought him one the very next day, and now it is pure heaven in our house. It is by far their most favorite toy!!! It is also very educational, so you don't have to feel guilty about them playing video games!!! Awesome job once again LeapFrog!!!",540
2,"The DVD was Great Quality, fun movie for the entire family, I would recommend it for all. Great bible story",107
2,"I have actually seen this whole series as a fan sub, and it was exceptional from beginning to end. It is a must buy.",116

2,I'm allergic to all dairy and soy. Finally I found a dairy free milk that tastes good and not like dish water. thanks.,118
2,I got this after I gave birth to my daughter and used it when I wear something that clings to my body. It works wonders at making my belly look flatter. It is hard to put on at first but after a while I got a hang of it. I am a size 0 from Gap and got a XS from here and it fit and works for me. It is hard to move and sit when you wear this but do make you look much much better.,380
2,"The gameplay is realistic, the graphics are incredible, and the cars really seem like their going 225 mph. The game does support steering wheels, so I would disregard the other reviews. One problem is that there is no rear view mirror in the in-car view. Create-a-car isn't the greatest either, but other than those few problems the game is great.",347

As a freelance photographer, I get many requests for still life photography, but sometimes I run into problems like bad lighting, background, etc. This little studio solved my problem! The only draw back: the lights heat up REALLY fast! You have to shut them down every 10 minutes or so, or you will start smelling things!",410
2,This is a great TV series-some of the props remind me of when I was growing up in the 50's. Characters are well-developed and convincing.,137

2,I found this book at the library and likes the images. I did originally think the story was a bit complex for my 2 1/2 year old but now she wants me to read it over and over! I like the southern accent that's written into the story. And I definite DO NOT need to change the words to make it understandable!!! We will need to buy our own copy so we can read it when even we want!,378
2,"I would give this book 4 1/2 stars if I could, it was so much fun to read. I was pleasantly surprised at every turn and just thoroughly enjoyed this book! Nonnie St.George has a great sense of humor and for a first book, plot, characters and dialogue were all excellent. I look forward to reading more of her books and with a bit of polish, I'm sure her next ones will all be 5 star rated.",389

2,"I first read this book when I found it in my local library, and liked it so much I went round every 2nd-hand bookstore I could find until I found a copy. Iwas so upset when Thowra died at the end, I cried my eyes out!I still read it again and again though.It's so descriptive, like all Elyne Mitchell's books, you can see a picture of all the places in your head while you're reading. I just wish she'd written more silver brumby books.",436

Co-authored by the president of the Irish Georgian Society, ( Who also photographs many of the houses & castles in this book) it supports the view that Ireland produced great architects and great buildings. It is a wonderful photographic and historic record.",354

I scan everything from book pages, B&W and color prints, and negatives, to transparencies, and it does a great job.",308
2,"I think the cd is a quality project. since 18 yrs QR has endured time, lineup changes, diff producer and label. NO one wants a carbon copy of the old.The one thing that i like most about the album are the lyrics. QR is back and they proved they can bring back II in a big way!",276

2,"This book it's of essential importance for all mid-level delphi programmers. If you like to know the low-level working of common data structures of the IT software engineering (or if you like to build one), then buy hands down this book: it's the best around. Moreover the ezdsl (the author free library) is the fastest implementation that i have seen. Personally i look that ezdsl/delphi is faster than the STL equivalent under c++.",433

2,I received a sega genisis 8 years ago and the graphics are not great but you have alot of fun on the game. I just wish they still made games for it especially car games when I received sega genisis I thought it was going to be a cheap system that would break in three days but it has lasted a long time but I just hoped they would continue to make games for sega genisis.Thanks,377
2,"I enjoyed this movie and the casting is great. It is about the conflicts between the mafia and American Italian policeman that were born and raised in the same neighborhoods. The leading female role played by Mia Sara is the wife to ""Joey"" the police officer in the film. I think there are 1-2 actors from the HBO Sopranos in this film too. This film was made before the Sopranos became a big hit. I recommend this film.",420
2,I have been looking to replace an old pair of ear muffs for years and have been unable to find them at any retail stores. I have tried the new styles that are in the stores now and they aren't as comfortable or easy to store in your purse. I could tell from the description that they were the same as the old pair. They arrived quickly in the mail.,348
2,"I was given this book as a child, I don't remember how old I was...I just remember this turned into my favorite book. I still have it on my shelf today (I'm 33 with no children yet) and occassionally pick it up to read it.Such a great story to remind us all about respect for others and that looks aren't everything when you have kindness in your heart.I highly reccommend reading this even if you are an adult.

After 10 minutes on Amazon I had found the keyboard I wanted for a price I was happy with I ordered it without a hitch. It was waiting for me after work just a few days later and has worked flawlessly ever since.,337
2,This is one of the best books I have ever read. The writing is amazing and detailed. This book is about a girl named Oyuna who lives in Mongolia. Her greatest dream is to be in the big horse race. She goes on an exciting quest to the Khan's Palace. She has lots of exciting adventures. You should definitely read this book.,323

2,I thought the book Sounder was interesting.It kept me guessing about the parts.Like when part of the jail had blowN up. I thought the dad wasn't going to survive.To my suprise he did. Then when he came home half paralized that really suprised me.After all the interesting parts and all the exitement it was good.Although the part I didn't like was when both Sounder and his master died.They could at least lived for anothor year together.Besides that I really liked the book.,475
2,Another great movie with Richard E. Grant. Highly recommended if you like good movies. Some really funny scenes and characters.,127
2,"Hand and RingI had a hard time putting this book down! I have read a good many of Anna Katharine Green books and am really enjoying her books, this being one of the best so far.There are multiple possible guilty persons to a murder that happens in a small town in NY. The story twists and turns and kept me guessing throughout as to the outcome.",345
2,"This is David Lynch's film school final project, and is legendary for its humor, bleakness and impressive special effects for The Baby. Stop looking here if you want to buy it & go to Lynch's website - that's the only place where it's available, and it's not Amazon cheap, either. It takes a very special type of personality to enjoy this movie - if you didn't like Blue Velvet for its weirdness, stay FAR away from this one!",425
2,This dictionary was very helpful to me because you're able to work backwards to find a sign you've seen but don't know. I only wish they had more handshapes in it.,163
2,"THIS IS ONE OF THE SADDEST AND BEAUTIFULLY-WRITTEN BOOKS I'VE EVER READ. LOVED THE HERO & HEROINE, THE DIALOGUES, THE STEAMY LOVE SCENES, AND MOST OF ALL, THE ACHINGLY TENDER ENDING. I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION.",230
2,"Although my husband and I know we are in the minotity, we both love this film and couldn't wait to own it. I have shared it with others and I know that the secret to enjoying it is to be in a good place in your life, happy in your relationships. Unhappy people will not find it funny. Fortunately, we find it funny and endearing.",329
2,I played Catch Phrase for the first time at a girls night out. It was so fun! We played for hours!!,99
2,I liked this series. Interesting to think of the position of second sons in our society thru the lens of this story. Writing was fine and would make a good movie.,162
2,Don't come with instruction and have to go to YouTube to learn how to use it. The price is good and meet my minimal needs.,122
2,"beautiful small greenhouse, but a bit difficult to assemble. some parts missing but were supplied in short time. thanks for a good greenhouse.",142
2,"I happen to really enjoy this CD. The girls sound great and the lyrics are very catchy. My only gripe is with Puffy. Sure he found the girls and produced the album, that's all good. But does he have to be in any of the songs? That annoying ""uh huh, yeah, come on"" is getting very old, and only serves to ruin the songs. In the future, more girls, less Puffy.",358
2,This movie touched me so much!! It is about so much more than just lesbian sex. The story and the acting was excellent. Piper Perabo's acting was superb. I absolutely felt her pain and rage in this movie. Anyone who has been in love will feel her pain. This tearjerker is definitely a welcome addition to my movie collection.,325
2,"I was afraid to buy used item, especially CD for kids. I didn't want to have a lot of scratches but this one looks like brand new. Now I will buy only used DVD. New ones are so expensive according to the ""used"" and believe me there is no difference! Love it!",258
2,"The book is not Hemingway's best effort, and consequently has a reputation of being a mediocre, thinly-disguised autobiographical sketch.The parallels with Hemingway's real life are obvious: The hero is an American WWI vet who returns to Venice at midcentury and falls in love with a much younger woman. But so what? Aren't writers told to ""write what they know""?The criticisms of this book chiefly stem from the fact that Hemingway wrote others that were better. But, judged on its own, it is an enjoya",503
2,"I gave this to a friend for her baby shower and she loved it! She said it was so awesome, that it kept her from having to always bring a blanket to the car and it removed so easy for washing, it also kept the carseat clean.",223
2,"I'm from the old school but I prefer the Karate Kid re-make over the original!I loathe the day that I become ""old"" and fear new takes on old art. It won't happen to me because I keep an open mind; but sadly, many others don't.In 2010 we get a remake with much better fight scenes and deeper emotions. The movie is visually stunning and -- what can I say -- simply brilliant!The audience was captured for 2.5 hours and gave a standing ovation at the end.Magnificent!!",466
2,It's great for computer maintenance. The ability to blow air is one of the things I like the most; but the extra attachments have the ideal size for dealing with dusty small electronics. The price is just right in my opinion.,225
2,"American Gods by Neil Gaiman is a thrilling, thought-provoking tale of forgotten God's and their quirky existence on Earth.A long read, worth every minute, this book paints a picture of our world that is dark, delicious and delightfully wrought with deeply disturbed characters. I really enjoyed the story and writing style. Highly recommended for the dark masses.",364

2,"I love all Neutrogena products, especially this one. It has such a lovely smell that lasts all day You don't have to use a lot, just a couple of drops right when you get out of the shower or just pour it in the bath for a clean scent and soft skin. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Neutrogena products.",312
2,"I first heard Gunnar Madsen on Sex and the City. I couldn't figure out what song it was, but I would play it over and over with Carrie's voice over and everything. Then I figured out it was ""Anna"" and a moment later bought this CD. It is better than I expected, only having heard ""Anna."" I play this CD all the time. It is perfect for when I'm reading, driving, cooking, doing anything. It's fabulous!",401
2,"Product arrived on time and in good condition. Quality of leather is quite good. The only thing that keeps me from rating 5 stars is the size. The 14 inch length is measured from the ends of the ""ears"". While they do have zipper pockets in them, they are quite small and shallow. The main body of the pack is only 8 inches from end to end. All in all my wife still likes it and will keep it.",391
2,"Very touching, very realistic. Great Acting. Made me cry more than once. This movie makes you love Morrie and makes you wish that he were alive today.",150
2,"Billy has moved on. Unfortunately, a lot of Pumpkins fans cannot. They are stuck in their lame 90's warp. Corgan went on to write more sweeter and humbler material that shows a progression and status of where in life he's at. The best songs: Yeah, Come With Me, Honestly, and Heartsong. I gave this 5 stars but the Jesus I track should have been edited some instead of the full 14 minutes. With the breakup of the short-lived band, thankfully I plenty of bootlegs to last me. :D",478
2,"It is the exact size as the original, has a better fitting cover and I am very pleased; would re-order",102
2,A very real story. Brings the reality of war at sea to life. A classic read for people that enjoy stories about the sea,119
2,This bible is great. It shows the original wordsand tells you the in-depth meaning. Veryrefreshing.,99
2,Even if you are not familiar with Arnold Lobel's Classic duo - you will enjoy this witty musical. If you do know the Frog and Toad books - this will enhance enjoyment of both musical and books. The music has a sophisticated 30's sound - Great jazzy orchestrations and the lyrics are giggle for both kids and adults. There is not a lot out there that is this good for children and entertaining for adults - rates with the best of Disney and Pixar. My two year old loves the show - but it is appropriate for ages 2 to 92.,519
2,"This book is an amazing find. After reading it several years ago we have been giving it as a gift to everyone we know. You will not be able to put it down once you start reading it. So thoughly researched, it will change the entire way you think about the role or forests and trees in the history of man.",304
2,"This book is a great introduction to ASP. Since it's a ""beginner's book"" it's not going to cover everything you need to know, but it's a fantastic start! If you know nothing or very little about ASP, this is an excellent choice for you.",236
2,"I started this video exactly 6wks post parting after a c section. It is a decent workout at that point and I'm thankful I had it. But I quickly found it to be a little too slow and not challenging enough. It is hard to find the time to do the whole workout with a newborn. I wish it were a little shorter, more challenging and to the point. I did like some of the exercises so much that I do them on a regular basis when I get a free 5 min and don't have time for the video.",474
2,"At first I found Barbara's rate of speech somewhat slow. But it grows on you, particularly in the PM and breathing practices- her voice is very relaxing. She does an effective job explaining the postures and breathing techniques and I have learned from her, which is always wonderful.",284
2,"This is probably manson's 3rd best album. Worth it for the most part, although some of the songs just make you want to jam something sharp into your ears repeatedly (mister superstar, Man that you fear) The other tracks (especially beautiful people, irresponsible hate anthem, the reflecting god, and wormboy) more than make up for this. While it is my opinion that GAOG and Holy Wood are better, this is tied with mechanical animals for 3rd. At least it isn't smells like children. So, in summary, great, but not the greatest.",527
2,I loved th?s book. Spencer wr?tes beaut?ful clean sentences w?th just the r?ght amount of ?magery. These people seemed pa?nfully and outrageously al?ve and the f?xes they get themselves ?nto are funny and heartbreak?ng all at once.

However, once I put it on the mattress, not only did it fit perfectly it was also very soft.",369
2,"I had the cassette when it was released way back in the late eighties. Needless to say that the original tape was worn out along with its several copies. Now the CD never leaves the deck. Sweetest Smile, Wonderful Life and Finder are the best songs on this CD. The music and lyrics are just great. This CD belongs to the collection of greatest music of the last two decades.",374
2,"I bought this book as a read aloud for my six year old and yes, she loved it. The illustrations and hand written notes from Cinderella to her dead mother added a degree of postmodern hilarity perfect for a smart nine to twelve year old and for me as well. This book makes a great gift.",285

2,"I am so pleased. Easy to use, fairly long cord, nifty swivel head gets in all the corners and under edges. For stubborn spots I just jet it steam a little longer and they came right off. Floor drys really fast also. So simple, just grab it, pour some water in and it's really ready in 30 seconds. When you're done, just drop the mop head cover in the laundry and put a new one on.",380

It's radio when radio was exciting, fresh and entertaining. That's the ""howlin on the air"" CD in a nut shell. Great sound quality, great oldies and lots of great memories. Google Wolfman Jack for great websites that have interesting facts about the Wolf.",430

If you like a good suspense-filled thriller about the end of days that starts with a plauge and riddled with the conflict of evil vs. good--then this is the movie for you. It features the husband/wife team Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis along with Rob Lowe, Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwold, and many others.",413

Some other reviews talked about the earpieces being short, so I was a little afraid of getting child sized glasses, but they fit perfectly. These glasses are great and a refreshing break from all those huge over-sized glasses with colored frames that every girl owns.",451
2,I read some of the other reviews prior to buying this. They were exactly right about the clip. It is not deep enough to be used as a clip-on. I keep it in my pocket and gym bag. It is great to see the steps I've put in. It is great feedback to my workout and weight loss efforts. It is handy to chart your progress because the unit stores your data for several days. I would definitely buy again or give as a gift.,414
2,"The Brepohl's book surely is the best book about the theory of the jewelry's affair's that I know, but isn't a project book. Is a textbook well written, with a very good english translation (the original is in german).The theory of metalurgy, that is lacking in the others books on the field, is update and well presented.In the end of some chapters there are few examples of student work, but their level is very high, and isn't showed all details of how to get it. If you want to know why and not only how, you must have this book.",533
2,"I have owned my DW7331 for several years and just recently purchased the dust hood. I can't believe what a difference it makes in reducing the amount of mess in my shop. Use of the dust hood with my dust collector creates almost no dust or chips so cleaning up aftewards as almost unnecessary. With thicker stock there are a few chips which escape, but 6/4 stock or thinner planes with barely any free chips. Don't wait and waste your time cleaning up when this little beauty gets the job done for a great price.",512
2,i have been watching this movie for years and i think it is great. anyone who grew up watching strawberry shortvcake will love this movie,137
2,"""I paralyze"" is my favorite song, and it's Cher's too! The song is amazing, but the rest of the album is pretty boring. Try to find an import single somewhere, and if there isn't one, buy this cd, it'll probably be cheaper anyway.",230
2,The book is a delightful story about horseshoe crabs. The quality of the book was very good for a used book and arrived quickly.,128
2,The speakers were delivered very promptly and they were easy to mount. The sound quality is outstanding. I am very pleased with the purchase.,141
2,"This was definitely not what I expected, but as an Elvis-phile, I rushed right in and bought it, without realizing what I was getting. I didn't like it on first pass, but having listened to it several more times, I really do like it. If you like the Elvis Costello genre of music, you will like this.",300
2,These are fantastic for spy costumes. In addition to looking awesome these glasses allow you to see who's coming up behind you. Great for surprising your friends when they try to sneak up on you or just astonding them with your uncanny ability to tell who just entered the room.,278
2,I saw this on Showtime a looooooooong time ago and I loved it so much it still pops into my head from time to time so I decided to now buy it.,142
2,"I bought this toy for my 1 Year old daughter as a christmas present, but her six and four year old sisters love this toy too.They all play together on this toy.The kids just love it. Great toy",192
2,Soaring soulful vocals. This album never fails to make me smile and relax. Close your eyes and float away from whatever bothers you.,132
2,"The only flaw is that it is HEAVY and cold on the bottom. Otherwise, I seem to be sleeping pretty well with it. No leaking problems as others stated.",149
2,"I found this book, despite it being out of print, through a third party vendor serviced by Amazon. Finding it was worth the effort since it is an extremely useful supplement to The Journey from Abandonment to Healing. I recommend getting it, if possible, and encourage the publisher to get it back into print. This book fills out the details and the exercises discussed in The Journey... book and together the two books provide an essential package to aid recovery.",465
2,"It's an interesting example of how far you can take a system, it's a well-done RPG on its own merits, and having played it now I can say it's easy to run. I enjoyed it and recommend it.",185
2,"14 clear tracks. Our favs are Louis Prima & Louis Armstrong, #1& #2. They're upbeat, fast & different. Then it bogs down. Kind of loses the ""Swingin'"" concept and moves into a jazzy feel. But, still a good listen if you find a copy cheap enough.",245
2,All I can say about this book is fantastic! There is so much in this wonderful book that I could understand unlike the dummies books. And the index and glossary and command reference is a sheer delight. I sleep with the book now for obvious reasons.,249
2,A great collection of Conan tales by the master storyteller Robert Jordan.A truely worthy successor to R E Howard.The use of language captures a nice period (old style) feelThree excellent tales to sate the hunger of Conan fans,227
2,"This version ia great! A little different from the Picture Show but they belt-out the tunes like they're on stage, just what I love! Tim Curry is still a god amongst mere mortals, let us all give thanks to Richard O'Brien. Amen.It was great when it all began, I was a regular Rocky Horror fan, it was over when he had the plan, to start a working on a new type of Transvestite clan (A picture show!), now the only thing that give me hope, Is shouting vulgarities at a screen & smokin' dope, Rose tints my world, keeps me safe from my trouble & pain...",551

Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger.I will tell just one story.(just about the beginning)- Todd had a haircut. But a barber is strange.He cut off his ear!You will find out about the next story when you read this book!Good-bye. ^^,388
2,"As an older returning non-traditional student,for me, this book really answered the questions you don't even think to ask but should. It really helps overcome a lot of anxiety for returning students, especially on Math.It also gives you an excellent game plan to follow on studying,and life management for those married students or single parents returning to school. It's worth the small investment. It is well written by someone thats been there.",448
2,"I love these aluminum tumblers!! There are almost identical to the ones that Mom had when we were growing up! They still keep everything cold, especially milk.....We highly recommend them!",188
2,"If you like John Woo's style, get this movie. If you like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible, get the first one. If you like more plot and suspense movie, get F/X.",161
2,"My grandnephew kept showing it around. He probably doesn't know what it does, but he and his dad should have some good bonding time.",132
2,i finished this book last night and cried. my son asked me what was wrong. but everything was right. that's what you get with a good book. things can make you cry and be right and be good. i tried to read another book the same night as i have several waiting for me...but it felt like cheating...i needed to spend more time with the memories and the people engaged still with me...this is one of those books. things shall remain.,429
2,"I have a Sony H5 which is a great camera, but pretty expensive (not to mention cumbersom to carry around). I bought my Samsung about 3 months ago to take out at night or boating...places I want to take pictures, but don't need the zoom or quality of a 7mp camera. It works great!. The pictures have all turned out well. It's fairly easy to use and while not as small as some compact cameras, it fits nicely in my purse or pocket. The only thing that I was disappointed about is the lack of a traditional viewvinder.",515
2,"I wanted to know more about how my horses feet are trimmed, and what I could do to keep them maintained and healthy inbetween farrier visits. I was VERY impressed with the quality of pictures, and the ease of explanations for the proceedures being talked about. I have since gone back and used it as a reference tool. It's a book you will use more than once!!",359
2,"I just gave this to my ds for his 1st birthday. He loves it, but after 3 minutes of riding, he was standing up and kept doing it. I read the other reviews and just ordered the seatbelt from step2 from their push around buggy! (they didn't charge me) Can't wait to get the seatbelt so we can go out for more than 2 minutes!",322
2,"Simple and humble piece of wrist wear. It keeps good time and is durable without being bulky. I'd recommend this watch to anyone who wants a solid, simple, inexpensive wrist watch",179
2,"We have had the Honeywell air purifier in our son's room for two years now. Every few months, the light comes on to replace this pre-filter. I always get them through Amazon and have no problem. They are quick and easy to replace. You can tell they really work because they are good and dirty by the time they need to be replaced (and I even change my A/C filters every three months with the most expensive filters). I'm glad we have this!",439
2,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 6 months old. She absolutely loved it. In fact, I just started packing away many of her ""baby"" toys (she'll be 3 in 2 months) and this was the only one that she protested so I left it with her ""big girl"" toys. Every Leap Frog toy I've bought her has been wonderful. They're all so educational, attention-grabbing and durable.",378
2,Marlene addressed everyday issues which make you think again about how you look at things. A must read book and I would recommend it on [...] book club list.,157
2,"I had to get another unit because after 5 months I was changing the filter again and turned the item up to see the bottom better. It is not suppose to turn that way. I cracked the piece and small stream of water shot up into the air when I would try to use it. Aside from my rough housing the product, it is easy to use, and easy to remember when to change the filters with subscribe and save. The water tastes good and I am happy with this product.",449
2,This is the best Mp3 player you could get at this price. Not only can you play any Mp3's but you can play Mp3's that are write protected. I bought two of these as a gift for my brothers and they absolutely love it! The device is as small or smaller than a pack of gum. I recommend this to anyone.,296
2,"This robot works! This is no toy. When I was given this robot for a gift my first question to my wife was, ""Can we return it if it doesn't work?"". I was really skeptical. Boy was I wrong! The little robot really cleans, and cleans well! As a test, I vacuumed with our regular upright and then had Roomba come in behind to see if it could pickup anything. After Roomba finished its job, its dirt bin was full! It's worth every penny!",432
2,"This is one of my favorite books and I had preordered the movie after i saw it in theaters. And a few days after it came out on sale I already had the dvd. Amazon's delivery's are fast and very reliable, and I was able to track my order",236
2,"This gives me some sense of what it would be like to live with the Sioux. Simple enough for a child to read. No magic, but worth reading.",137
2,"Pampers are by far the best diaper if you have a large baby. However, Amazon claimed that the item would ship within 24 hours but it took over a week for them to actually ship the product which means I didn't get the product until over two weeks after I ordered it. So . . . I'm very pleased with the product and the price but not so much with the service. I ended up having to buy diapers at Walmart to hold us over until my Amazon order came in.",447
2,"Two aging, but wonderfully talented actors (Olivier and Hepburn)give much spunk and depth to this delightful video. They had been lovers many years before, but she has forgotten him. He never has forgotten. Memories are woven throughout the tale and the revelation is delightful.",279
2,This is really a nice iron that does a wonderful job. I love the extra steam it puts out & also the burst of steam if you need it.,130
2,"I love this. It gives me that extra little boost while working out. It makes me sweat more and helps me lose weight a bit faster. It isn't a miracle or overnight fix, it's just a nice assistant.",194
2,I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH IT YET. I KNOW I WILL ENJOY IT BECAUSE HE REALLY IS FUNNY.,90
2,"As I have a tendency to hit targets that are harder than normal, it behooves me to make sure that I have enough darts for my crossbows - just in case the Zombie hoard appears.the seller sent these quickly and I got them just a few days after ordering.",251
2,I had soooo many questions and it answers them all. Don't listen to the reviews that say it's no good it's great. I'm 10 and its perfect. Great for ages 8-12. Really well written. Totally age appropriate. MUST READ.,215
2,Great selection of music. Callaway performs with great respect for lyric and melody. Good listening.,100
2,"I watched this film for a class project reference. I read the play and, though the film shows us what the story is about, the play itself is far more interesting and intense. It doesn't stay true to the words 100%. I would recommend it to anyone.",246
2,I would highly recommend this iron. It works better than any other iron I have owned. Well worth the money!,107
2,"This is a nice book for film lovers. Ebert answers all types of questions from his readers. These questions range from script development to film review to questions about individual actors and directors. Of course, Ebert infuses his trademark wit and humor throughout the book. Sample question: How many scripts that get purchased by movie studios are actually made into real movies?",384
2,"It is important to note that this book is written by a Frenchman, but one who is very sympathetic to the US. It is written in an academic style, and at times assumes a knowledge of French history and culture that may be lacking in the American reader. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating study of the subject, particularly the first bits concerning French attitudes during the 18th century about North America's degenerative qualities, and the French sympathy for the Confederacy. Some of the later bits were a bit drawn out, but all in all, very interesting.",557
2,"Liked the function of this device, however, it was incompatible with my Comcast cable box (Motorola) - never could get it to operate it, so I had to ship it back. Worked great with all other components.",202
2,My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much. It goes pretty close to the Biblical stories.It is such a wonderful story that kids and adults will enjoy. Glad we saw this one.,172
2,"A story that blends the technology with the people, not sacrificing either while still maintaining a good pace. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genre.",166
2,Purchased at the recommendation of a friend as a christmas present for son's girlfriend (both politically active twenty-somethings). She couldn't put it down! Now I'm dying to read it myself.,191
2,"A great album, a great singer, gone forever :(there isn't much justice in a world where this amazing band had no shot yet nickleback, the anti-christ of rock, is played every hour on the hour!! Gregg Fulkerson, rest in rock and roll piece my friend, don't be fooled, you will be missed.",286
2,Jerry Lee sounds as good as ever. One of his best works to date. Great addition to my music library,99
2,"Though ""Healing Journey"" isn't available on CD at Amazon, you can buy it from Dr Miller's own website. Amazon's rules prohibit me from giving the URL, but if you Google ""Emmett Miller"" you won't have any trouble finding it.I've listened to this tape repeatedly and always enjoy it. Sometimes it puts me to sleep, which is even better.",334
2,I enjoyed the alblum. It is the original versions done by the ones who originally did it. Glad to see this product is still out there all these years later.,156
2,This is great product for people who loosing hair or on the medical process. This would retain the confidence as you are in good sharp. Highly recommend !!,155
2,"I found this book very accessible with many examples that were easy to relate to. In other parenting books that I have read I found that the authors created an academically acceptable book, but in doing so they generally missed the target of reaching non-academically trained parents. Mr. Bledsoe hits the mark in a simple, digestible ""reference"" book. I think of this book as a ""reference"" book as it often go back to it as my three young girls grow.",451
2,"This book about Alaskan crab fishing is somewhat dated, but it gives a wonderful first-hand account of what crab fishing was like 20 + years ago.",145
2,"I keep looking for Regina's work. It is different from much of the standard Jazz and has a certain sound that even makes ""A-Tisket A-Tasket"" interersting (Cut 7 on this CD).",173
2,Edna Kramer gives such wonderful insight to mathematical evolution that she makes it come alive! To understand the struggles these math giants went through to solve problems that we now learn in a short time provides a real grasp of the solutions and how they came into being.,276
2,"It's a practical guide on defining service characteristics and design principles in multiple levels, from component implementation to application design to enterprise architecture. Very digestive material.",205
2,"Best protein and value I have seen. No added sugars. And no added artificial sugars, which is a big deal!! And difficult to find. Aspartame and Sucralose are so crappy for you, why would you work out and then feed your body that junk? The same goes for fructose or other flavorings and sweeteners. None of those chemicals here! It's great to find a healthy protein.",365
2,"I really like this book, and encourage everyone to read it. It is much better than the movie that stemmed from it. As a result of liking the book more than the movie I searched for a book with the older cover. I ordered from this person for that reason. I was very disappointed when I found it had the movie cover instead. Other than that misleading fact the service was great.",377
2,I use this item religiously and got this one for my granddaughter who has braces. Biggest problem is the breaking hose problem but have now found replacement items on Amazon so it's not such a big deal. I do feel that WaterPik could easily correct this problem with a small spring stiffener at the handle if they wanted to but they probably would not sell as many units.,370
2,"I read this book when I was youger, and it is still a book that I fall back to reading over and over. It is a quiet and calming book and McKenzie is an author with a dream. She is insperational in telling the tale from a females view point. I am now in university studying to become an English major, and in my books this is still the best book I have ever read. She brings you to the softer side of Camelot. This is the first book that brought me to love the Arthurian Legand. In my advice, it is a book worthy to anyone reading.",530
2,I got this as a christmas gift and was amazed at the game quality. The graphics are awesome. My dad walked into the room on Christmas while i was playing and asked if my home team was playing. If you dont look closely you may think its an actual hockey game on ESPN.,266
2,I needed a component cable from my DVD to my ceiling mounted projector. The cables look and feel like good quality materials. This is actually video and audio cable but I used it for a component cable and it worked fine. Good price for what I got.,247
2,I ordered this product because I just had a new Mohawk laminate floor installed in my kitchen and I didn't really know how to take care of it. I used a dry microfiber mop and a light misting of the floor cleaner and it did a fantastic job and took just minutes. The floor was dry enough to walk on almost immediately. I'll probably stay with this product.,355
2,just another great BBC series! watched all 4 seasons and loved every one of them. brendan coyle is a great actor,112
2,"This documentary re-affirms why I love this game so much. I'm a white male who speaks English and VERY broken Spanish (I basically only know soccer terms) but I've played with people speaking all different languages before, and this film accurately depicts how soccer (and sports in general) is the one true universal language that can build relationships between people that would otherwise never get to know each other. This is a must see for anyone, not just those who love soccer.",484
2,"I'm Italian and love to cook -- these canisters fit my kitchen perfectly. The exterior is gorgeous, and the interior has a clean satin finish that's perfect for storing dry goods like nuts and grains. This larger canister easily holds 1 lb of rice, nuts and bread crumbs.The lids are a finely-textured and understated black plastic, with a very smooth-functioning metal clasp. They come in two different designs and two different sizes; I have both and highly recommend them.",475
2,I find the bright LED more pleasant to the eyes than the old traditional incandesant bulbs. I like the long lasting LED's over traditional light sources. It fits on my music stand nicely and makes the notes on my music show up better than more orangey type light. Thanks for making a great product.,298
2,"With cello, contrabass and drums, Bonfire Madigan appears to be a group of indie-rockers who never could shake the classical music training of their youth.",155
2,I LOVE this camera! It is very easy to use and has LOTS of great features! It takes great pictures!,99
2,This is the best little pick me upper I ever had. I am disabled and it is a great product for me.,97
2,I love Crocs.They are tops and everyone in the family wears them.Best thing since apple pie.I will wear them always.,116
2,Amazing viewing. American history from the Native people's perspective is absolutely heartbreaking.Thank you Amazon for making this DVD set available to us Aussies.,164
2,"have to say this is the only sports bra that keeps my watermelons up. It does more than its job. I love this bra a lot, it sits my breast ups and hold them in place.",165
2,"If you've seen the movie, then you pretty much know exactly what you're getting when you buy the soundtrack. That being said, I love the songs from the movie, the other ones are OK if you're into folk music.",207
2,"This is a great phone. Memory is easy to progam. The phone has 3 memory keys for emergenies and 9 additional memory keys for personal numbers. It can be used on a desk or hung on the wall. The only thing I don't like about the phone is the buttons on the handset. However, I knew about this feature before purchasing the phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a good basic phone.",405
2,"My wife is the one who likes it. She reads it as soon as it comes in. She gets a lot of information from it, and puts it to use. We just renewed.",145
2,"I was unfamiliar with Ms. Adair, but my wife's stepfather, a retired musician, gifted her with a couple of CD's, and so I discovered an impressive performer with a great sense of song selection. I have discs by jazz greats Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck, and Oscar Peterson, among others, which are not superior to Ms. Adair's take on Gershwin. If you like melodic yet jazzy tinkling on the ivories, mostly mellow but not boring, something a step up from pure pop renderings, this one's for you.",489
2,"I bought this game when searching for Baldur's Gate 2 to tide me over, but it turned out to be much more than that. This is by far the best game I have ever played or seen. The story is immersive and interesting and the landscaping is extraordinary! It literaly creates a world for you to explore and discover.One cool feature is how you can actually tell exactly what weapon you're using when it is equiped. That made it really neat. The weapon designs are so awsome too!This is the best game I have ever played and I highly recommend it!",539
2,"This is a fabulous score, filled with beautiful passages. It contains what is arguably the best cue from film of all time - 'Stealing the Enterprise', a grand heroic segement that will make your heart swell with emotion. The other great passage is 'Bird of Prey Decloaks', an action cue not completley devoid of feeling. -1 star (should be two) for the puzzling addition of an 80's rock version of the theme and the omision of the escape from Genesis. It'll do though.",468
2,"For fans of early British humor and pre-Monty Python, this is worth including in your collection, even though the quality of the recording is not the best. With his college friends, my husband saw a production in Chicago during the ""Fringe"" American tour. Several sketches he saw in the original show are not on this recording, and he misses those. But this brings back fond memories, and many laughs, of that live performance.",427
2,We LOVE the Kidz Bop CD's. They're run and a great way to pass the time in the bath or dancing around for the kids. THey're fun and allow the kids to sing a long. Just GREAT.,174
2,Great second season offering of this hilarious series!! Can't wait for the 3rd season.....,90
2,Dr. Michael Savage has hit another home run with this provocative book of his no-nonsense expression of conservative ideas. Dr. Savage does not apologize for his concrete conservative stance on the important issues facing our nation today. If only the vast expanse of our liberal college campuses would begin to expose our next generation to some of this truth serum...,369
2,Doesn't get any better than nostalgic British Invasion golden oldies! Selection was great and quality was good as well. Would recommend this CD.,144
2,I'm not a huge fan of the true crime genre. But agreed to read this book after a friend could not stop talking about it. I'm glad that I did. This book is terrifying. It lets us all know that anyone can be a victim. The author succeeded in making you feel like you were there. READ THIS BOOK!,292
2,Why is the Roots song from the soundtrack of the movie The Wood(1999)? They should of put a new song on the cd.,111

2,"This book arrived in only a few days. Even though it is a used book, it is in very good condition.",98
2,"Wow, what a great book. Instant classic that I will probably revisit in the future. It was pretty much the adult version of a modern day 'Lord of the Flies.'",157
2,I like to research the products i buy. I came across this juicer on the australian site for breville. Eventually i was able to track down the distributers in england. Its the best purchase i have made. It is not too noisy at all and is very easy to use. the juice is very concentrated and tastes really good. To clean it is a brease. well worth the money.,355
2,"It is the first Dan Brown book that I read, and I must say that his writing style captivated me. The story is full of action and unanticipated turns. Definately a recommended read.",180
2,"I bought these for my toddler daughter after trying several pairs of flipflops with the strap on the back. These are the easiest to keep on and for her to walk in. Also, the thong strap stays in the right place between her toes instead of slipping around between the other toes! They are really cute and very sturdy.",316
2,"In times of crisis, effective leaders understand the urgent need for honesty and candor, for the kind of truth telling that allows for healthy, creative responses....It is one of the graces of crises that truth telling unfetters the imagination and offers hope and direction...In the present church crisis, Paul Dinter emerges as a significant truth teller...Dinter has succeeded in writing a brave memoir and a penetrating critique of the current structures of the institutional church.",487
2,"The prior review gives you details regarding the book. If you enjoy epic books with many climaxes, turns and twists, this is a book for you. It's as good as any book I have ever read.",183
2,Zojirushi NSRNC-18A Automatic Rice Cooker and Warmer with Floral ImprintThis product made in ThaiLand...........?!,114
2,I have loved the Crunchie bar since I was a kid. They were so hard to find then and so expensive. Buying by the box can be dangerous but very cost effective. This is a great price. Careful of ordering during the warm season. Mine arrived a little melted. However they set back up fine and tasted perfect.,304
2,"Montreal's Voivod were Canada's answer to Metallica and one of the titans of the thrash panteon standing along side Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax.This concept album, with it's Metal Hurlant imagery and it's shredding speedmetal, is intelligent, complex without seeming pretentious and the soundtrack to some amazing sci-fi novel never written. The album art done by Drummer Away is also worth the purchase with pictures for each song.Best tracks: tribal convictions, brain scan",477
2,I bought this seat cover for a 2013 Explorer. It fits the seat well and seems to be protecting it. It folds up and fits under the seat when not in use. Good product so far and does what I bought it for.,202
2,The calculator came on time and as described. My daughter is using it with no problems and loves the color. Thanks!,115
2,I read In Christ every day and it is an eye opener. It should be republished. I thank God that I have one. I wish that I could buy more to give to friends.Jimmy Crowder,168
2,Unless you really like aliens and predators you probably will not like this. I enjoy both movies so I found this to be perfectly ok.,132
2,The mouse was awkward at first but is a lot easier on your wrist once you get used to it. The center click is harder to push than most mice. The Magnifier and Instant Viewer features are nice. This mouse is more comfortable than the traditional design but there is room for improvement.,286
2,"I had been looking for this CD for a number of years. I have the album version and I love it. I thought that the CD could have had a little more bass added, but it is still one of my favorite RE outings. The entire recording is a throw back to the late 1980's when I was a teenager and enjoying Rare Essence. Wonderful CD!!",323
2,Switch does a great job in turning tree lights on and off at a touch of a finger. The little Christmas Tree metal piece you touch looks just like an ornament and connecting wire blends in with the tree. Saved me crawling on the floor to plug in or unplug the tree.,264
2,When my wife was fighting cancer a very wonderful and special friend gave us a copy of this book. It always seems to hit the right spot and got us through some very tough times. Thank you Esther. We too have passed on many copies to others.,240
2,I really like this cd!All I need is some rum punch and my caribbean breeze!ALL the songs are nice.,98
2,This was a great book. It keeps you guessing and on your toes not knowing what reacher will do next. This is a great book to turn into a movie.,143
2,Ive been using Brita for years and their product functions pretty well. The only issue is the packing. The filters are placed and packed in a messy way so that it looks like used-filters.....,191
2,"I found the author's writing to be clear and concise, easy to understand, no legalese. The author's subtle humor and well-researched documentation of both little-known and well-known sports facts, legal manipulations involved, and legal precedents make this compilation of legal cases such an easy, pleasurable read that even those who thought they knew all there was to know in the sports world will be amazed, surprised, and enlightened. A great book for anyone who loves sports trivia. Knowledge of law not a prerequisite. Think Christmas gift!",547
2,"I absolutely loved this! There was nothing offensive in it!I think it would make a great family read aloud! I am home-schooled and love to read! This book is about a boy named Eben. Eben really wants to see the Seven Wonders of the World! His Pa makes a deal with him: If he can find the Seven Wonders of Sassafras Springs, he'll get him a ticket to Colorado to see relatives! I could not put it down! This is now on my favorite books list! I cannot wait for the sequel! The book says ages 8-12 but I think all ages would enjoy this book. Happy Reading!",553
2,"A nice, hefty feel, a big blade - quality USA craftmanship - and beautiful materials. I love it so much, I immediately bought more. This is truly an heirloom item. You won't be disappointed!!!",192
2,"This is a CD I never get tired of listening to. Every song on here is good and some of them are truly fantastic. My favorites are I Keep Forgettin, That's Why, and I Can Let Go Now (which should have been a really big hit song.)If you're new to the music of Michael McDonald because of his recent Motown albums, then you should do yourself a favor and pick this one up, too.",374
2,"The author provided excellent advice but in some respects, for online marketing, is already dated since he did not provide any information on the new rage, Facebook.Still, lots of good ideas presented and certainly motivational.",228
2,"heard about this book from a friend and was unable to put it down! as a healthcare worker, the character of older jacob has insights all should be aware of and consider. vivid imagery and a fascinating plot. highly reccomended",226
2,"This was a very good movie... It was suspenseful and had a good plot. It took a while to get ""into"" it. What I mean is that the exciting parts didn't happen until near the middle. It wasnt' really that scary but it served it's point. It's a good movie but, if you're looking to find a scary movie to rent then don't get this... get something like ""Halloween"" or ""Scream"".",371
2,"I work with plants and have for the last 31 years found this product about 20 years and it's the only shear I have and will continue to use. Light , easy to handle and cuts great",178
2,The story of Eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and don't allow you to get completely sucked into the book. Overall its worth reading.,268
2,"An absolutely gorgeous piece of fine writing again from Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters, with a lyrical tone of such depth which is only matched by the emotive lyrics. Trust me, this is real music at it's best.",210
2,"This is the 11th in a series of videos called ""I Love Toy Trains"" and I think it is the best yet! Jeff, who has been around since the first video has grown with each one and does a great job of being the M.C. He does magic tricks, talks about the Maui Ocean Center and shows a great deal of knowledge about the toy trains featured in the video. There are still the jokes and a puppet for extra entertainment, even flying saucers and aliens are included in the fun! Great addition to the I Love Toy Train series.",511
2,My family loves these. My husband and I stash them in the freezer and then thaw them out for a few minutes to perfect chewiness. If you're not accustomed to food made with real ingredients that aren't loaded with sugar to camoflauge the fake junk in them then you may need to retrain your palate. Persevere -- it won't take long!,329
2,"While perhaps not for the absolute beginner, this yoga sequence is definitely an excellent way to get a solid upper body and back workout in a short space of time.",163
2,"My wife is a formally trained Chinese chef. She frequently uses the first one of these we bought. We've had it for about 2 1/2 years and it has held up to all that use quite well. I recently bought her a second one after finding it on Amazon at a greatly reduced price. It is still in the box, held in reserve for the day when she needs it. The price was great, and the delivery prompt.",386
2,It works exactly as it's supposed to. I've had no issues with this handle cover at all. Way too easy. And it works with my other brands of cast iron as well.,157
2,"I enjoyed this movie alot because of the ""irony"". The guy is a Mormon (These people are supposed to frown at stuff like that[Porno]) But he just wanted to offer his wife the best and he tried it then the movie was a big hit, something he hated and his wife found out. The story was good, so was the ending.",306
2,"I liked this movie, not because it was a break from the originals but because it was what defined the series. Most people who criticize this movie obviously did not watch it several times over to get the whole point of it! The first 2 movies never truly explained what the curse of Michael Myers was and how it came about! Nor did they emphasize on the history of Samhain like this one did! This movie attempts to explain that and Halloween 6 (Curse Of Micheal Myers) finishes it up! Try to read more into a movie, people, and not be so quick to judge!",552
2,Was my first time purchasing this rice. I thought the jars would be bigger but then again I'm used to shopping at those big club stores. lol . I made some Mexican Rice Pudding with this rice and it came out so smooth and creamy. Just excellent. I was overall satisfied with my purchase. Was delivered quickly.,309
2,These bars are excellent. They taste wonderful. Smooth chocolate and delicious coconut flavor. I will buy these again!You will not be disappointed!,147
2,This was the first book I've read from John Saul and was not disappointed. It had mystery and suspense.,103
2,"You won't believe the power this inexpensive hand vac packs!! I have not found any vacuum, including my Dyson, that works as well. The only down side is it is really loud.I am going to purchase another for my upstairs--I love it!",229
2,A fast moving book that could be a true story!! I place this right up there with Patterson. I like a book that makes you not want to put it down and this is one of those,169
2,"Bought the blue/heavy one and did the twist and release exercise. Of course it is hard to tell if just this has made by tennis elbow better as I took a lot of rest too, but after using it a few weeks my arm is a lot better. It's for sure worth the try. The best is after your arm is better is to focus on hitting a clean ball. I think especially bad serving and framing backhands are the source for tennis elbow...if you play tennis of course.",443
2,"I very rarely need to change belts with this. It's as though the belts last forever when you unclog them with it. I compare using this to using a pencil eraser, except that the surface is moving and the eraser is not. Buy this. You won't regret it. Why waste money on new belts?",278
2,"As the author states, this is not another book of how computers work. I had been looking for a book that explained how a microprocessor does what it does. And with this book I got that and much more. I should also say that this book is good only if you love computers, because otherwise, it would be a little bored, especially because it goes beyond software into hardware and talks a lot about digital electronics and logic gates. But to me, it is very very good and I recommend it to everyone who has a real interest in computers.",532
2,"This is an amazing book. It opens up the Bible in a wonderful way while still being easy to read and understand, very, very highly recommended.",143
2,A sound summary of IBM's prescient Person-to-Person development in the late 1980s; makes some of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) ideas seem quite old-fashioned - but then someone who's been using e-mail since the late 1970s and instant messaging (on IBM VM internal systems) since the dawn of time gets a lot of deja-vu feelings these days.Easy to read - and well worth trawling through for people working on modern P2P developments. (I confess an interest - I worked on early prototypes of the IBM product in mid-1980s),511
2,"this is a story about a girl who doesnt want to leave her parents to go to a school with her aunt and uncle. the surprising thing is that as she meets other people, she starts to like it. she also meets a show offy girl and a cute boy. they go on a school skii trip and... well... thats for you to read and find out :P theres some romance but not too much, and the idea is really sweet. anyone can relate to the feelings in this book and i definitley think that its worth buying it. good on you, sharon creech!!! (LOL)",518
2,"works good. sometimes it seems to have not enough power, but that might be a normal. I would buy it again...",108
2,I thought this book was very interesting and different book. I liked the pictures because they were very realistic. I enjoyed this book because I like boats a lot. I also liked the way Chris Van Allsburg sometimes puts the same characters in his books like the dog named Fritz.,277
2,"i want to review the some clinical laboratories methods ;as serology,parasitology ....andhematology.",100
2,This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. I watch it every year so I decided to buy it. love it funny and romantic,117
2,"This is Clint Eastwood at his finest as opposed to talking to a chair at the Republican National Convention. The movie is exciting, fun, and funny in places with a great sound track. It's a must see for Western fans. It's almost as good as Unforgiven.",251
2,"The book is alive with Dickensonian intensity and detail, and expands onto new turf Wolfe's mean spirited but comic vision of a materialistic America. But it is flawed in plot, structure and the development of characters as they respond to the events (such as they are) in the book. I spent most of the book entertained by Wolfe's powers of observation, but waiting with growing impatience for something significant to happen. When events reached their climax, I was disappointed.",480
2,"and it is deserved. This album is one of the best I heard for long.4 singers with individual and extraordinary voices. One cannot decide if one is better than the other. But there is no need anyway, as they are unbeatable together.Would like to see you live but I learned that this will not happen anymore. Such a shame!!!",322
2,Lots of info and casting #'s with dates.Nice to have 85% of info all in 1 easy to find book.,92
2,A fine album of late 1980's funk/dance music done gracfully by the diva Grace Jones.,84
2,"An extremelly well written book describing essential and advanced techniques in General Thoracic Surgery.As a junior doctor, resident in Thorqacic Surgery, I concider this book to be a most usefull guide both in training and in practicing in the field of this outmost exciting specialty.I personally enjoyed the clariness of the text and I tend to concider this book as a unique combination of a comprehencive textbook and a concise atlas of Thoracic Surgery.",459
2,I purchased three of the ceiling mounts for my garage. Installation was very easy and the quality of the product seems good. All three bikes lifted all they way to the ceiling with not problems and I've got my floor space back. A must have for an organized garage.,264
2,"This item was exactly what I ordered. Its not a great musical in my opinion, but I didn't buy it because I liked it, I bought it because I needed it.",149
2,"I just had to throw a good 5 stars for this album. These guys have always been good and, having lived in Lawrence and attending KU, the only thing I regret is not attending while they were forming and playing up there! Road Rash forever!",237
2,The book has the most amazing photographs that truly celebrate the Earth. I would highly recommend this work of art. It's spectacular and I'm certainly glad I purchased it.,172
2,"As we were shopping for a Wii we had several people stop and say just get it-you will love it! Well, they were right! We are off the couch and enjoying family games again. Even the senior citizens are bowled over (pun intended).Great fun that never ends.",254
2,"I installed this on my Rv to quickly disconnect the battery for storage. This with the help of a 5 watt solar charger keep my battery fully charged and always ready. This switch feels well built. You will need your own hardware ( bolts, terminals, ect) to get it installed. Get one.",282
2,"This album has some very creative beats which wake up your mind. The other albums offered here (ragga jungle anthems 1 and 2) are excellent as well, but Toasted has some extra flavor and innovation. Ragga Jungle Anthems 1 and 2 are good if you like to hear junglist versions of dancehall hits. Toasted is the choice if you want a pure high-grade jungle experience. Also, the album is packaged nicely.",400
2,"This is a ""plan to use for life"" system--I feel better than I have for ten years and lost 15 lbs. the first month--without sugar cravings, which still astounds me.",163
2,These were a decent price. Kid needed better reeds..... moving up in the world. This box was exactly as described.,114
2,If you like the sound of Africa then you will like this. Great harmony and rhythm. Easy listening. Great buy.,109
2,"For critics of this book, the author explains in the preface that calling this book ""complete"" is a marketing tool--albeit one that is a bit misleading--and that there is no way a reference on Crystal Reports will be ""complete"" enough to answer every single quesion. Granted there are ways the book could be improved (more screen shots, more typical scenarios, etc) but so far this is the best CR 9.0 book that I have found. Perhaps book publishers should consider this.",470
2,The best for your hardwood floors - it maintains the natural luster without a oily finish. Cleans the floor without heavy scrubbing and you should try not to use soap and water on wood finishes so this is a great product.,221
2,"I bought this book for my daughter, who recently adopted her first cat. I have read part of the book, and there is a lot of great advice in it--now if I could just get my daughter to read it!",191
2,"we have used this Haggadah for several years and have found it very good, especially when non-Jews are present at the seder. It is clear, enjoyable to read and also,very pretty.",177
2,"I expected studying for my first mcse exam to be tough, but it wasn't. I had several friends recommend this book, so I picked it up. I was concerned about some of the topics that may have been out of my reach, but following the exercises in the book made it perfectly clear. Thanks for helping me pass the exam.",311
2,A must read for all who want to be more knowledgable in their faith and have an answer to those harder question.,112
2,"Pros: everythingCons: NothingComments: I don't see what these random 4 stars are talking about, i.e. bad indoor pics and slow charging. This camera is great, small, fast, high quality, and easy to use. I bought mine for 150$ and it even came with a partially charged li-ion battery. It's nice not having to take the batteries out all the time also, just plug the AC adapter in it and let it sit for a while. I'm VERY glad I got this camera.",440
2,"And surprisingly, the rest of the Billswere, too, even though Super Bowl mag-net Coach, the ex-CFL'r Marv Levy wasnow retired [late note: He returned in2006 as G.M. - at 81!]. Fine film eventhough Wade Phillips is nothing to com-pare to his fine Coaching father, O.A.'Bum' Phillips!",282
2,So far I've used it once. In general it's pretty slick. A good and cheap lube for beginners starting out. Make sure you wash with soap completely. If you don't you'll still feel it on your skin and stuff. Otherwise it's good,224
2,but the first sunglasses i've taken care of.solid structurewill retain its valueyou will see these glasses sell for a lot in vintage stores,139
2,The filter is not an exact fit but it works just fine when you tighten down the filter case. I can't speak on the high performance aspects because I don't ride enough.,167
2,"This is the second GF Grill we've purchased. As we live in an apartment & gas or charcoal grills are not allowed, this electric grill is great. A breeze to clean, just wipe off with a paper towel, and easily taken apart for thorough cleaning. And it cooks quickly. A winner!",274
2,"As I expected, this was like all Daniel O'Donnell's DVDs, ""GREAT"". I really wish the whole show could have been on one DVD.",123
2,"The reviews never disappoint me! I intended to give this as a gift for my nieceyet, I fell in love with this tortoise I felt like keeping it for my room!! Well, Might as well buy another one.Never too old for this. LOL.",219
2,"This item was one of a trio of Kroil products is used as a surprise Christmas gift for my husband. Having just the right tool or product for a task or project is something he takes pride in, so this gift blew him away. He is probably the only guy in the state of Ohio who found this under the Christmas tree.",308
2,A great advanced workout. I love the 6 pack Abs in 6 minutes it really does work! It's not an easy workout but easy doesn't get the job done. Another must have to your workout collection! In my opinion The Biggest Loser Boot Camp and SWAT Workout are two great vids to get you into your best shape ever! Plus who doesn't like Commander Tom he's amazing!,353
2,"Once you get to grips with the (Bolshoi) excercises being described in measures rather than counts it's a wonderful resource for the serious teacher and adolescent student. There are lots of clear(if old fashioned) photos: Plisetskya and a young Maximova included. This book should be on every ballet teacher's bookshelf, along with theory books relating to Cecchetti, Kirov and English schools of training... A serious book for passionate bookworms like me.",458
2,A good deal - a buck each - but a different brand than pictured. Seems ok though.,81
2,I don't know how good this group is. But my girlfriend searched the world for this CD. It might be good from what I hear about them from her.,141
2,"The unit is easy to use, convenient. Cord wrap up is great. Nice size to sit on your cabinet. I use for grinding my Flax Seeds I take daily for health. It's the perfect size for daily usage to grind the flax seeds. Excellent for small quanity .",244
2,"I am thoroughly enjoying my Staub cocottes. I also purchased the 2 1/2 quart round. I've made about 1/3 of the recipes from ""Glorious One-Pot Meals"" now, and have also been using it for braises and stews. It's so well-made that it's almost a work of art.",254
2,I use this on a daily basis and it BY FAR is the best lotion I have ever used. I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.,117
2,I purchased this product since i had heard a friends before. I am very pleased. It's easy to use and very nice looking. The performance is next to none i've heard. My only complaint is the remote programing and the onscreen displays. I'ts just not as simple as it should be. Other than that highly enjoyable!,308
2,I believe it took me all of 3 days to read this book simply because I couldn't put it down. I will be sending this to my best friend to read along with a fan that has our secret language on it. It was sad yet very complelling...,228
2,"These bottles really work! I was skeptical at first, but my son actually seems to have less gas after eating from these bottles. I found the same results from Avent bottles, but those cost more. The only downside to these is that each bottle has 5 parts, so if you don't have a dishwasher they would be pain to clean. You should also know that if you plan to pump into these bottles you will need an adapter.",408
2,"My one year old will play with this for hours. I think the recommended age should be a bit higher than six months though--she had no interest in it until she was older. Once my daughter could pick up the balls and put them in the holes, it became fun for her.",259
2,As far as I know the person who wanted the lamps are happy. I don't know any more. they haven't complained.,107
2,"After many hard listens to this cd, I have come to the conclusion that it does stand up as another great Cro Mags release. Yes, it does have more ballads than one would expect but they are so well written and the combination of ""Age of Quarrel"" singer Jon Joseph & ""Best Wishes"" singer Harley flannigan is truely a treat to the ears. This album has the best of both worlds, although is not as good as the afore mentioned titles. Simply your collection is not complete without Alpha Omega, the third Cro Mags release.",516
2,Cute book for my nephew to go along with his rainbow in my room light projector! He is in Kindergarden.,103
2,"I loved the movie ""All the President's Men"" when I watched it during a journalism class one summer at Northwestern University. But you know how movies are: they're always more exciting, more quick-paced than the books they're based on. Not so in this case. Woodward and Bernstein bring the All the President's Men -- and their interactions with them and with the people who worked for them -- to life in such a way that one needn't have lived through the Watergate era to understand what really happened. All we need to know now is who Deep Throat was!",552
2,"For such an age-old festival, only the purest of documentary art will do it justice. Commentary would spoil the images, and Nadeem Uddin instead provides us a mix of music and sounds that strengthen the already powerful and beautiful images he recorded of millions of devout Hindus on their way to salvation.This is Direct Cinema at its best, empowering viewers to make their own judgments, or just to enjoy a montage of filmic images that defines a unique congregation and community of mankind.Would that we could all share such an experience. Now we can.",556
2,"I was so looking forward to this CD before it came out. It was SUPPOSED to have every one of my favorite Alanis songs on it. So where the heck is the superb track, ""So Unsexy""? It IS on the cover!!! Good collection, but NOT the IDEAL one I was looking forward to.",263
2,"This was one of the old records that my mother used to play at Christmas time when I was a child. I spent probably 7-8 years looking for this specific album, and am so happy to finally find it. It is one of those things that takes me back to some powerful memories.I don't think anyone makes a better Christmas tune than Perry Como. I think even Bing Crosby is second to Perry Como, and of all Perry Como albums that I have previewed, this one is the hands down best.",467
2,"This is the second pedometer I have had, and it works MUCH better than my old one. Try it you will not be disappointed.",119
2,"This is a book that every photojournalist, press photographer, or combat cameraman should own. The works of Tim Page, not only highlight the personl hell that or soldiers msut endure in a time of war, but also those journalist who risk thier own lives in order bring home the story of our brave men and women who fight for their country.",337
2,"Ok, I admit it. I'm probably a bit older than the target audience here. But while some plot twists get un-kinked, others get so badly skewed it's... well, almost hard to believe. Mostly as good as the rest, but the whole ella thing just hurt my suspension of disbelief. Maybe she wasn't pure evil, but please... Does anyone else think it was a written for TV series? Especially with the whole recent rash of super-girl shows...",427
2,"Excellent juicer, very powerful, the feet chute is wide enough to accomodate even medium sized apples and large cucumbers as well. It's not as loud as I expected and meshes aesthetically with my other modern appliances. The pulp is bone dry (with a slower juicing hand) and a lot of juice is extracted from each piece of fruit/vegetable. All in all it was money well spent and is a product I use often. It's also very easy to clean!",432
2,"Sonic Mayhem is the real masters of industrial music... everything they produce, turns out to be exellent. So this soundtrack is a must have.",141
2,"Free shipping, delivered by careful handlers from Eagle. Easy to use. Great picture and overall great shopping experience.",122
2,The latest release from Big Sandy and his Fly-Rite Boys represents a departure onto the road less travelled into the realm of subject matter that many modern songwriters fearfully avoid -- the pain of the human condition. From revenge to despair this album truly pays homage to the roots of country with influences from George Jones to Hank Williams to Bob Wills. The lyrics are heartfelt and thought provoking. The musicianship is unparalleled. Lead singer Robert Williams angelic voice is reminscent of early Elvis. Listen because the NIGHT TIDE is calling you!,563
2,I think at first it hard just like any thing will be but its fun to have and learn on at a low price.,101
2,This case fits the Nuvi 660 very snugly. It serves its purpose well in that it helps to protect the screen when the unit is not in use. One potential problem is that some screen protectors will come off when putting the GPS in the case because the fit is so snug.,263
2,"A gem of a book, with practical, thoughtful ways to encourage and enlighten. Beautifully written. I refer to it often. Recommended!",131
2,"This is the 4th pair of Rainbow sandals I have purchased for my college age children...and this one a replacement for some ""well worn"" ones! They are a great product and worth the money, yes a bit much for ""flip flops"" but these are not ""flip flops"" and are well worth the money!",279
2,"When I first heard of this book, I had to get it... I mean Richard Hell! I love him!From the second I opened this book I couldn't put it down. Not to say it was fantastic, but it was so real. It felt like walking into someone's brain (primal/animalistic urges). Fascinating.Through every chapter you got to know the inner workings of this addict, what moved them and destroyed them. In short, how fragile life is, and how misdirected we can be by our intuition under the influence of anything and everything. Air included. Buy this. Read it. Be disturbed.",555
2,"This is a really quirky movie, should be a cult classic if it's not! CRAZY FUN is all I have to say!",100
2,"It was time to replace my 25 year old Technics towers. I wanted something much smaller, without giving up the great sound I was accustom to. I listened to a lotta speakers from Bose, Wharfdale, Polk, and for the money, these were by far the best. Good bass, crisp highs & rich midrange sound. I'm very happy with these & I hope they last as long as my last set.",361
2,It is a fact. Playing video games alone isn't as much fun as playing them with your sister or brother. The only reason I bought a controller was just that. It still works today.,177
2,Got this as an apartment warming gift for my sister. Cooked a Tri-tip that day and came out great. Small size fits the patio well.,130
2,"It had a great moral that anyone could do anything he inspired to, but it took lots of practice and hard work to go to great heights.Jonathan was an inspiration to some of the younger gulls, but others sat on the shore doing nothing. This is a good example of the real world",274
2,"a fine cd of jumping xmas tunes. The upproar that caused them to pull the version of ""silent night"" was concern about that verse "" round young virgins, motherless child"". Oh well, sounds good to me!",198
2,"A very mature and comprehensive work on yoga, suitable for beginners as well as advanced students.The suggestions how to procede are sound and based on experience. The cd joint with the yoga sutras is beautiful and makes you feeling like in India.",247
2,"If you like dice games, this is a must. You wouldn't think there would be a lot of strategy for a game that plays in a couple of minutes. 1 round of 9-18 holes is pretty fun. But try playing a 4 round tournament with 4-8 people. Do you roll conservative for pars or do you have to be aggressive with birdies and eagles to overtake the leader. Very competitive with a group of people. Great way for kids to learn the golf scoring system.",436
2,"Very attractive, especially for a sports watch. It doesn't look budget at all and can easy be worn even when you aren't actually exercising. It's easy to read and has nice options for timing, laps, etc.",202
2,"I just love Valerie Bertinelli. This movie is a must see. A fun romantic family movie, you will enjoy it.",105
2,"This is listed as only subtitles but Sentai always dubs anything that is a Bluray release, and has been confirmed by them.As far as this series is concerned it is a must see. It has a fairly unique storyline or unique elements and the characters are hard not to love.",267
2,"I liked this book a lot until the end, which I didn't like so much. The mystery and suspicion surrounding the main character was well-done.",139
2,"This is another book that I frequently recommend to people who come in our shop. It combines scientific information and metaphysical information, is easy to understand and has great photos. The theme from twilight zone does NOT run through your head when you read this book. I wish he'd write another book with more stones.May your best day of 2004 be your worst day of 2005",374
2,I saw this movies as it was being aired. I thought it was so family-like. The end results family is your best friends. It is a nice home movie.,143
2,I returned this product to you on Dec. 14th by mail and I still have not received a credit on my credit cared. Please let me know how the process is going and why I have not been credited my money to my credit card.,215
2,"I have several of these canisters in varying sizes and I love them. They are functional and attractive. It isn't obvious, but the gasket has a right and a wrong way to fit. If you get it wrong it keeps falling off. Took me a while to figure that one out!To the other reviewers who asked, this size takes a 5lb bag of flour with room to spare or nearly 7lb of rice",363
2,Enjoyed this beautiful cake stand. Added to the cake very nicely. Bride and Groom were very pleased.,100
2,"What's to say they work, I have had one for 8+ years and thought I had better get two more for my other bikes so I didn't have to remove it each time I wanted my GPS on another bike. I might get one more as I keep getting more bikes. Hope this helps, I have a Garmin Emap. Works for me.Mike",290
2,"Reading about James Cagney written by himself was the best way to understand Mr. Cagney. I enjoyed his anecdotes, incidences and thoughts throughout the entire book. I appreciated this actor's wide range of acting from gangters to song & dance man. Truly an enjoyable journey into this very fascinating humble man's life. This book is written as though James was speaking right to you--having a conversation with you. Most enjoyable!",433
2,"I've been using a hand sharpener from the local grocery store for a while. This beats it hands down.I just finished sharpening a paring knife with nicks in the blade. I was able to grind down the nicks and leave the blade looking and working like brand new. I was even able to shave a bit of my forearm with the paring knife when I was done!4 Stars instead of 5, because it has to surprise me to get 5. I expected high quality from this and that was easily met!",461
2,i was reading this book and it was fabuolous. i haven't read a book that fast in a long time. read this book it's one of sue grafton's best.,140
2,"This screen does everything we needed it to do. It functions well, the pulldown mechanism works great, it works with our LCD projector. For the price, I'd say it was a bargain.",176
2,"When I read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts. I thought, ""Yeah, right."" But you really can pick and chose and combine what you want. You can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio. It is up to you. Or you can choose from the basic low, medium, or high intesity workouts. This is a great workout DVD and Denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part. I'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home.",533
2,"My daughter and I had read the book and wanted to see how the movie compared. The book is better (as are most books) but as far as kids movies go, this one's a winner. The kids are cute and not sassy, like on many sitcoms. The adults are more than 1-dimensional. The relationships between the characters are nuanced, but not too complex for an 8 year old girl to understand. Really great family movie.",401
2,"I was amazed to locate this excellent, little known film, it may not have been the most popular film but the acting is super, I have watched it over and over. The seller sent it new just as described and it arrived quickly, way before I expected it to get to me. Will use seller again.",285
2,"The Ultimate Matrix Collection on Blu-Ray is good but does not score full marks. Picture and sound quality are very good. However its missing the digital copy for Reloaded and Revolutions and the movie starts up immediately once the disc is inserted... really guys, it should load into the menu first.Other than that I have the entire Matrix series on crisp clear Blu-ray... Woo Hoo.",383
2,"Gifford's fiction is often an unholy pastiche of styles and devices, and this technique is perfectly suited for his memoir PHANTOM FATHER... I highly recommend it. Deserves a space on a short bookshelf that includes Angela's Ashes and The Liars' Club.",251
2,"I had this on cd and listened in my car driving around during errands. I really had fun listening and looked forward to hopping back into the car for the next installment! Great, loving story.",192
2,"I listened to this book on tape. The reader did an adequate job of presenting the story.The basic plot and twists are interesting. However, anyone with any knowledge of how the legal system works would not buy into this storyline. This trial would become a mistrial many times over. Fortunately our legal system is better than Grisham portrays it to be.I did not feel this book was as compelling as many of Grisham's other novels. However, the ending of this book was much more satisfactory than most of his other stories.",522
2,"The Croozer 535 3 in 1 is perfect for my needs and I am very happy with my purchase. I wanted a double jog stroller and bicycle trailer and after a lot of online research couldn't beat the price...everything is included. I also have a small car, so I have to disassemble the stroller to fit it in my trunk, but it takes less than 5 minutes to disassemble and reassemble...it is very user friendly! I only wish the jog wheel rotated instead of being fixed...then it would be perfect!",482
2,I've been in love with this cuticle cream since I used it for the first time. I just put a little around my nails about once a day and my cuticles are very soft and nice. No dry and breaking cuticles. I was really amazed when a friend asked me how I have such nice cuticles - so it must show. It is so much better than any other cuticle product I've ever used.,360
2,Hands down - the best battery operated toothbrush for the money. This toothbrush excelled at cleaning my teeth & it uses a simple AA battery. I bought this toothbrush for around $20 and used it well over the recommended life of a toothbrush. Will it last forever? No. Should you really expect it to? Of course not.,314
2,"I was spending a ridiculous amount of time working on my legs with my old Epilady. Based on these reviews, I got this one and I have been extremely pleased. For me, this is painless, though I've been using epilators for years and this one gets even the tiniest hairs. It's great.",279
2,"I read this book long ago, which I picked from the pavement book sellerin Delhi. I read and reread it. Since I have lived as a child with anglo Indians in Central India ""Dongargarh"" a Railway colony, I could relate to stories easily. I am Angloindiaphile Indian and I admired chalres effort of preserving bygone era. Loved reading this book. DR Pardaman Singh Nagi",364
2,i love Newhart. but for years now we can only order season 1.can we please have the other seasons? please?,106
2,"I was surprised at how useful this book is. When I first looked at it, I thought the questions looked obvious and simplistic, but they work very well to start off team meeting sessions. The authors provide lots of good ideas about how to use them, and little anecdotes to inspire you to believe that the questions can actually change the way you do business. I've used them for meeting kick-offs and to jump-start moribund discussions.",435
2,The disc that I ordered is defective. Pleae provide procedures for a refund or exchange asap. Thank you.,104
2,"When I read this book, I was hoping that it would be just like the other 4 books in the Vampire Chronicles. Nope, this book isn't like the other 4, in fact, Anne Rice takes Lestat down a different way than I thought that she would. I really love the Lestat character, and he's really interesting... I just hope that the ""Vampire Armand"" is better than this one is, and any other Vampire Chronicles books that Anne Rice produces in the future.",442
2,"I received two wine glasses as a gift while in England and have added to my collection, always purchasing in England. I hand wash these glasses and I have never had any problems with flaking or chipping.",203
2,"This is a Koontz novel that has monsters, but they are not genetically engineered or have crashed landed on earth from outer space. The scary monsters in this book are all human, and sick as any of the other evil stuff Koontz has wrote about. More of a suspense tale, it has some nail-biting chase sequences and some horror-type serial killer stuff going on in it. Koontz here is making a statement about big government in this book, and what Big Brother may do if you know too much. Great Read.",495
2,It works exactly as I had hoped. If it keeps me from losing my lens cap it is worth more than I paid.,101
2,"When I first heard Ava Adore on the radio (Y100 Philadelphia), I expected Adore to be the ""Arcane Night Music"" that James Iha described. The album is similar to previous Pumpkin's songs, such as Eye and TEITBITE. The power that builds up in Ava Adore, Tear, and Behold! The Night Mare is perfectly balenced by the melodies of To Sheila, Once Upon A Time, and Blank Page. Perhaps with the reaturn of Jimmy Chamberlain, the Pumpkin's will record some more of the heavy rock that is their heritage.",495
2,"Being a fan of Megadeth, it was only natural for me to find out about this side project of Dave Mustaine's. I ordered it and though the vocals are not sung by Mustaine, they are still great nonetheless. For any fan of Megadeth, this is a must have, as it is very similar to their music (post Rust In Peace--less noise, more understandable lyrics). The quality is excellent. 11 tracks, all of which are good. My favorite would have to be ""The Day the Music Died"". Get this CD!",475
2,"Anyone who hasn't heard Luce or any of the new cd, needs to check them out. Tom's writing and melodies are a cut above all others. This new cd Never Ending allows one to escape into musical wonderland. There is not a bad song in the bunch...very rare in today's music scene! Anyone who buys this cd will not be disappointed.",324
2,"This table is about twice the table you would expect at the price. Its size is ideal with a 2 passenger teak bench. Kompur wood is so like teak; we're staining our teak furniture to match the Kompur wood. It looks marvelous with the 30"" round folding table. Fit and finish are A Plus. Can't rate durability yet or it would have 5 stars.",336
2,I love this CD. I think it is a very interesting mix of new age flavor and old school melody and design. I find it extremely relaxing. Its great for both chilling and thinking but not if you're looking to get pumped up. I gave it only four stars because I felt some of the tracks toward the end of the CD slowed down a bit too much and dragged a bit longer than I wished they would. But this imperfection doesn't take away from the sincereity of emotion the music embodies.,473
2,Good plot & first rate performance from Madonna & Willem Dafoe. Madonna is so sexy in this film.,96
2,"I'll warn you that not every review in this book is hilarious, but the ones that are make up for all other shortcomings. When you read this book, you are not just reading about movies and what makes a bad one, you are reading well written, witty essays that say what many of us are probably thinking and feeling, but can't quite find the words to say. (I think his takes on Godzilla are the best example of this.) I have to say I wish there were nmore bad mives that Ebert could watch, simply cause reading what he has to say about them is so funny.",549
2,"I have became the biggest fan of Joan Sutherland lately, and I bought this set because of her. And I'm not diappointed at all. In fact, I'm elated. Not only do I get to hear THE DAME in wonderful voice, but got some lovely music and other charming singers as an added bonus. This cd has made me a Mozart fan. HIGHEST recommendation I can make!!!",345
2,A friend wanted me to buy this movie for him just for Josh Hutcherson's acting. And he gives the movie a five.,110
2,Growing up I always wanted to be Farrah and this documentry of her last days and passing was very well done and a good item to add to my collection of Farrah items.,164
2,Focus on about 450 well choosen phrasal verbs.Escellent choice of typical sentences in which the phrasal verbs are usedExcellent recap exercises at the end of each chapter that force you to remind Phrasal verbs defined in previous chapters.Some explanation for phrasal verb meaning not absolutely clear (just about 10 on 450)Some mistakes in the solution part.Very good choice for foreign learners.,398
2,"This was the 1st Dean Koontz I've read, although recommendations for his books have been suggested. While some parts drag on forever (mostly the beginning) the book was pretty cool. The only really bad thing was that he was a baker and the descriptions always made me hungry! Other than that Koontz has made his way permanently to my bookshelves.",346
2,If you enjoy the Flintstones than you will enjoy the 2nd season. I showed it at school to my 6th graders they enjoyed it. My only complaint is the audio quality is not the best on the older dvd's like this cartoon. It is fine for TV but have to turn the volume up and at school using smart board it is still hard to hear.,321
2,My daughter loves this mobile. The colorful animals have smiles and she responds enthusiastically w/ lots of coos. We use the other attachments as play toys. The music is nice and the sound quality is very good.,211
2,"Picked up a used jointer and purchased this as an upgrade. I was a little time consuming to install, and I recommend purchasing a new set of bearings to avoid having to remove them from the old cutterhead. The Shelix is well-designed and well-packed. Cut quality is excellent, and noise is markedly reduced. I am very pleased! Tips: make sure you torque each cutter to the recommended 50 in-lb to improve cut quality.",417
2,"It's very good. The noodles alone put all other soup noodles to shame. They're fresh, firm, and just the right size. The broth is darker and richer than other canned chicken noodle soups I've tried. It's also seasoned well with lots of chicken and veggies. Nice to have organic products that taste good!",303
2,"The packaging was done right with substantial bubble wrap and cardboard to ensure minimal damage. The frame is wood and not a cheap plastic or metal design with actual glass. In addition, the clasps and triangle eye mounts in the back create a snug fit and provide sufficient mounting options.",293
2,the book was as advertised and arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Pleased with transaction,97
2,"A wonderful book that does what few Civil War authors have: point out McClellan's successes along with his failures. Most of the books written about McClellan ridicule him, while Hassler provides a much more detailed and introspecive look at the controversial General. Hassler skillfully avoids the anti-McClellan animus that seems to posess far too many Civil War historians - Check it out. It's a rare find.",409
2,"Larry Blamire and his wonderful cast of characters outdid themselves in this sequel. If you liked The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, you'll love this movie. Watch it, then be sure to watch it with the commentary. The man truly is a genius! If you have not seen the original, but love old B monster movies, buy them both and enjoy! You won't be sorry and you won't be able to stop laughing.",384
2,"There are some CD's that you listen to once and know the lyrics by heart, and this is one of them. The first 4 songs are the best, but the whole album is worthwhile. My only complaint is a little diddy she says about ""Where'd you Throw the Ham"" or something like that, I wish I could just delete that from the CD. If you enjoy this, you will LOVE Patty Griffin ""Living with Ghosts"". Their voices are so similar it's eerie.",422
2,Easy read. Less than an hour.One of the greatest books on personal accountability I've ever read. I have made it required reading for the staff and lay leadership at my church. And also for my teenage children!Recommend for anyone who wants to be the person who stands out postively within organizations where layoffs are on the horizon.,337
2,"I've liked the movie Carrie ever since I was a kid and now that I'm older I feel that I can truly appreciate it for the horror classic that it is. The movie follows a young misfit by the name of Carrie White, who's constantly tormented by her peers. All she really wants to do is fit in, but her goal is seemingly an impossible one to reach because of her abusive mother and cruel schoolmates. The film is fantastic in my opinion and I think any one who views it will love it and start to sympathize with the title character.",525
2,"Excellent read... awesome research into all connected topics...But most of all, a thought provoking approach to thinking.I expected to find the book long and boring, but the gripping story line and the description of characters was just too engaging to put down.",262
2,"A very complete book written at a time when antibiotics were not the norm. I appreciate the candor, the openness and frankness the author uses -- also some of the language is amusing. I appreciate what this female Dr. had to go through during a time in history that was very tough, and all the case histories she gathered to make this book outstanding. Much insite gained. Good reference.",388
2,"Ok, I've read the reviews and I even own two of these mice and I love them. However I just thought everyone should know that if you use it a lot, this mouse SWALLOWS batteries (double A). Three months?? more like 3 weeks...",223
2,"I read reviews on several Forearm Crutches before I decided on these. They are worth every bit of the money. Comfortable and gave me the support I needed getting over knee surgery. They are well built and not too heavy. My husband is having his knee surgery in a few weeks and will also use them. I'm 5'2"" and he is 5'9"". They adjust well to both of our heights. I highly recommend them! An added plus..they were delivered fast!",428
2,"I bought this sharpener to keep all of our kitchen knives sharp along with my pocket knives. It works well once you get used to it. Holding the blade against the outside of the sharpener edge every stroke seems to be the trick. Also, if you have a sharpening steel, once you have sharpened in the machine, you hit the blade once or twice on the steel and you usually have a razor sharp edge. Works pretty good.",410
2,"Since reading Gates of Fire I've been hooked on Pressfield's work, both fiction (Killing Rommel is another favorite) and non-fiction (EVERYONE should read The War of Art!). But not since i read Shogun more than 30 years ago has a book transported me through time and space the way Gates of Fire does. The setting is so real, the characters are so genuine, and the action is so believable that you can almost hear the din of battle and feel the fear and anguish of those on the killing lines of one of the most important battles in the history of the world.",556
2,This is the second one of these I purchased. Nothing wrong with the first one. Just needed 2 of them. They bothwork great.,122
2,"I love this book. It's a great bedtime story. My favorite part is when Whitney is chasing the bee!I also love Kristyn's hair when Taylor yells ""Boo!"". The rhymes are fun and the pictures are beautiful. I think you'll love this book, too!",237
2,What an original voice in this beautiful tale of the trek west to Oregon. The author's insight into relationships caught me right away. But the beautiful descriptions of the land kept me going. It makes you consider the land and what it offered in a new way. I found the family relationships touching and the resolution between the character somehow felt right.,361
2,I love this movie. My VCR destroyed it because it had been played so many times. Mitch is a legend in gymnastics and it's great to have this ammidst my corney 80's movies.,171
2,This tea doesn't have a pleasant smell to me but it taste good with a little honey added to it.,95
2,"I use these canvas hangers for hanging up laundry that doen't go in the dryer. As you know the dryer ages your clothes quickly.They are so nice to dry your nightgowns or running suits, sweaters or anything that needs special attention. I highly recommend them-And they do not get wet from the clothes so they will last for years to come.",337
2,"Ordinary people in extraordinary situations. That is what Stephen King likes to write about, and that is what this is. The most terrifying part, especially to those of us who love the outdoors, is that it could really happen.",225
2,"Elton' s ode to the South proves tempting,evoking Tumbleweed Connection but falling short.One thing he does more is piano playing as he used to in his first albums.There is a positive feel throughout the record, Weight of the World talks about a maturing superstar while Answer in the Sky delves into the spiritual.My favorites,however,are Turn the Lights Out and My Elusive Drug.Although it took a few plays before I began to love it,I consider it inspiring.",459
2,"This product is great for the occasional snack, or extra side dish with dinner.The scooper, however, was a little skimpy (handle not long enough), but now I'm looking for a ""spider"" to use with it.Especially loved that you can just cover it, and re-use oil.Great product.",271
2,"This is a classic book that every software developer and manager should read. It explains the concepts behind the five levels of CMM. I know that might sound boring, but the author does a good job of keeping the book reasonably interesting. Most of what you read will sound like common sense, but in practice many companies do not use a lot of common sense when it comes to software development. So this book can serve as a guide to help software development organizations set realistic goals for process improvement.",517
2,"I have thoroughly enojoyed watching this program with my teenage daughter! What an amazing look it gives you into history, albeit through the eyes of a fictional family.",169
2,What a great buy! The extreme flexability and lightweight of this hose makes using any nailer much easier. When working on scaffolding you are never fighting the weight of the hose. I could not go without this hose!!,216

2,"I first heard about the donnas 3 years ago, on the radio, the local lounge, and thought hey were great!! You can also see girls in Drive Me Crazy and Jawbreakers, as themselves, It would so rock if they had played at my prom !! My favorite song other than ""Take it off"", is ""too bad about your girl"" !! Pick up the cd it rocks !!...",332

2,Once again Dale Brown has Patrick McLanahan in the middle of it all again. He keeps to his traditional style and makes it almost impossible to put the book down. I highly recommend this book.,191
2,"As long as you won't expect to taste as regular lasagna, this is pretty good as whole wheat lasagna. A bit gummy, different texture from the regular type, of course. For the health benefit with flaxseed, I can take it to substitute regular ones occasionally. One thing to point out is that one package may not be enough for traditional lasagna recipe.",351
2,The style and workmanship I like the most. I wish it would come in battery movement so I don't have to wear it all the time.,124
2,"Halloween 5: the Curse of Michael Myers, is definitely watchable for anyone. Whether you're not a fan of the series, or a die-hard fan, this film is a must-see. Series fans might not like Michael Myers mask in this entree, or how the Myers house has changed dramatically, but other than that, everything else is great. Danielle Harris is terrific! This time she shares a telepathic bond with her uncle, so she knows ""who's next!"" I definitely recommend this movie for any horror movie buff.",490
2,"I was Very happy with the Blu-Ray, no matter how many times I watch this film it never fails to deliver. Very well done and they picked the perfect actors to play the roles. It was nice seeing it in crisp HD, it for sure cleaned up very well.",242
2,Great story with great acting - A Must See for Anyone: The story is timeless - the music & acting are great - this is a video that is unavailable for rent almost anywhere - a shame!,181
2,"Well, what more can one say? The other reviewers were correct. It is an awesome watch. This is my 3rd G and I certainly wouldn't have searched this one out again if I didn't love it. Nuff said.",193

2,"I was hoping to buy a timer that allowed me to set specific times (you know, like on a clock). This one only has a few settings that have the timer on for one, two, or three hours after sunset. It responds to a photoelectric sensor that registers sunset and sunrise. If you are looking for a timer with these sort of limited settings, then this one is a good example -- it is tough and has lasted through a good deal of wind and rain without any problems.",455
2,"We read 6 books on the Big Island before going there (I know, a little compulsive). This one is helpful, but really the only two books you need are: Hawaii The Big Island Revealed by Andrew Doughty and Adventure Guide Hawaii The Big Island (Hunter Travel Guides) by Bryan Fryklund & Jen Reeder. The Fryklund/Reeder book is absolutely jam-packed with information. The Doughty is also packed with info and will have a few things the Fryklund book doesn't have, but it's main attribute is that it is an absolute joy to read.",521
2,"Icke has updated his previous works with more information, much of which has been seen on his website in the last couple years. He appears to have refined some of his views based on criticisms of The Biggest Secret, though the basic ideas are the same and are more thoroughly and accurately documented this time. This is a lot of material to cover, and Icke has made a worthy effort. It's an interesting synchronicity that this was released the same month as Matrix V from Leading Edge Research Group. The coming decade should be very interesting!",547
2,"I have been ordering from Peggy's Biscotti for quite some time and am never, ever disappointed. I'm Italian and bake biscotti and have home made biscotti from family and Peggy's is my absolute favorite!

2,"I bought the large dice for my 90-year-old mother. She loves to play games (Yahtzee, Farkle) but has a hard time seeing the smaller dice. The dice are larger and she can see them better, but I did not realize how large they would be. It is a little difficult to pick up 6 large dice to throw them. You need two hands. We use a cup to put them in and then throw. Otherwise, it is a great idea!",392

2,I absolutely LOVE this coffee maker. I am a new mother working full time and I can't survive the day without coffee in the morning. My daughter just turned 5 months old and I have learned that I must simplify my daily routine wherever possible. This coffee maker is so convenient it has changed my mornings and there is no preparation needed the night before. Just refill with water every few days and it's always ready to go. LOVE IT!,435

2,"This is the second Gerber product I bought. Both products exceeded my expectations. First off this knife is very light, almost all the weight is the blade and thats really the way an everyday carrying knife should be. The handle fits my hand well and seems study enough, would probably be stronger if thicker. The blade came sharp, but sharp is relative . Its not carbons steel so it wont stay sharp forever. Bottom line this knife is sturdy, feels like it can take some abuse, and at less than $20 if it breaks, you can always get another one.",544
2,"Overall, a very well designed and functional product. Too bad that the edges and corners of the aluminum sheet components had to be deburred, and the corners had to be rounded. If not done, the edges could cut your hands and the corners could tear your clothes or upholstery in your wehicle. Seems like fewer and fewer manufacturers are likely to completely finish their products anymore. I guess hand finishing is too expensive. That's why manufacturers are going overseas for cheap labor and hand finishing.",509

2,"an amazing work of theology... It not only explains our Judeo Christian Faith, but more importantly is a wonderful guide to a deeper relationship with our Trinitarian God... I believe this book will be an asset to any Christian believer... Pope Benedict XVI has a clear and precise writting style, his books can be easily read by anyone despite the diversity of background knowledge... He is not only a wonderful pastor and theologian but fantastic teacher and a very spiritual guide .",485
2,The Saeco Piccolo Steamer is really a good product.It's not that great on really tuff grease but it's wonderful on blasting grime out of crevices.I used it to clean out the inside of the refrigerator and it did a great job. It's great for getting into those tiny spaces that you can't clean.There's a lot you can do with this product. Smart Bargains shipping was very fast. Thanks so much.,389

2,Awesome. Gordon Parks is a quiet and little known American Icon. One that should never be forgotten.,100
2,I loved the access of both seasons at the same time. My mother is very ill and we spent hours together enjoying this series. It allowed us to have an activity together and gave us something to talk about.,204
2,"So yeah this event was so-so but at least the DVD's are back to the way they were. I won't post the fights cos other reviews already have them. ALL fights are on one DVD while the other has the Countdown show, Backstage bonus, and the weigh-in show. Plus it has all the intro's to the fights and all the Rogan interviews post fights. Keep em coming like this and I'll be fine. Pre and post press conference would be nice too. Enjoy.",432
2,"The blurb really says it the best...""There are more than 6,000 Chinese medicinals described in the Chinese medical literature, but only 260 of these are typically used in day to day practice.

2,"The only negative about this bible is the small fonts. Those with good eyes will not necessarily look at this as a disadvantage.

2,"I read this book because, like Julia Child, I discovered a deep passion for cooking late in life. This book made me realize that you are never too old to try something new and have a wonderful adventure. Julia was as natural a writer as she was a cook, and the story flows along beautifully. I also learned a lot about the post-WWII adjustments faced by France, and was able to use the book when teaching my high school U.S. History classes about WWII.",452
2,Sissy Spacek gives a great performance in this tale of a young girl who is severly taunted by her classmates. This movie is so thrilling Iv watched it 5 times already. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good thrilling and even revengful move like this one !,265
2,"I purchased this book to understand a little of the process of designing and making a custom interior. The designs are good, but maybe a little dated. For instance, it's mainly street rods and no discussion of the newer 'pimp' style look. No AV system installs - which I was most intrested in finding how some of the flowing speaker enclosures are done.Very good photography throughout... you can pick some nice ideas if you're doing a street rod.",447
2,"I bought this picture for someone who is a customer where I work, and we both think the quality on it is marvelous. This is a photographic reproduction of an original antique photo, blown up to portrait size and tinted in rich earthtones. It would look great matted and framed, which is what he's planning to do with it. This comes also with a printout biography page about Padre Pio. A five-star product you will love!!",420
2,"What a fun book, originally from Pittsburgh, I enjoyed all of the landmark references....being a mystery lover..I couldn't put it down. Quick, easy read that kept me on the edge of my seat! How fun...Can't wait for Mr. Sestili's next book!",239
2,"This is like the Cafe Del Mar series mixed by Ibiza DJ Jose Padilla. I think these tracks are similar so if you like that series, by Cafe Del Sol. Thanks for your time, Steve",174
2,Really nice support. I'm a 235lb man and is giving the support I need for my tranning. A little desappointed because I order 2 and the first shipment came with the thigtning knob broken; but hey no big deal I was able to put it in the door like it was suppose and have not gotten loose or nothing after all the pressure from my legs.Adjustable and a little tricky at the beggining in to how to put your feet against the door. Other than that no complains.,455
2,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The trials and tribulations this man suffers are unimaginable. Things go from bad to worse, and then even worse. This book doesn't let up; do yourself a kindness and read it now!",226
2,There are few of us Mother's of children with autism that can talk about Functioing Recovery. Our journeys are different yet the same. The dietary piece is a crucial aspect of the many therapies needed to achieve Functioing Recovery. Collectively we Mom's have a voice. Read our story Coming Through the FogComing Through the Fog: A mother shares her journey of her daughter's recovery from Autism and Sensory Processing Disorder to Functioning Recovery and ... providing helpful tips for other parents.,503
2,Can anyone tell me if the movie has the option to be listened in spanish?? i want to give it as a gift for my father in law who loves those bible movies.,153
2,"I actually didn't read the book, I gave it as a gift, but the receiver was very pleased and enjoyed it.",103
2,"As owners of 4 vehicles, this was a great option for us. It stays in place and can be moved from car to car easily. It has never slipped under any circumstances. Good price too.",177
2,"This is the best how-to book on getting rid of pain caused by injury, stress, or physical problems. The premise is that when a muscle is injured, it never forgets, creating a ""trigger point"". This book tells you step by step how to find the ""trigger point"" for your specific pain, and how to apply counter pressure to relieve the pain. I have disc problems in my back, and when my back acts up, this relieves the pain and gets me going instantly, without drugs or chiropractors. I highly recommend this book.",508
2,"Good ""comeback"" album/cd. Homage to Honky Chateau's ML&MH & some other songs revisit his better period, although it would be a while before he did a good song end-to-end. This is seen by most as hist first true step back up.",224
2,"I bought the cassette tape of this album when it came out. Now in 2003, I still listen to it regularly. It's simple, beautifully played music of the classics is very relaxing. If you need a tranquil moment, play this CD.",220
2,I just wanted to let you know that the head does not have a bubble level that is ubiquitous nowadays. I recommend it if you need a good solid portable leg and want to use a separate bubble level or change the head anyway.I strongly recommend Slik AF2100 pistol grip head for this tripod leg. As a travel tripod I couldn't find a better combination at any price range.,367
2,This map was in excellent condition and was extremely useful during our vacation in Italy. Package arrived in a timely manner and description was accurate. Happy customer; thank you!,182
2,I ordered this case for my canon sd1100 and like it very much. But I found although it's a great case for protecting the camera itself it doesn't give you room for anything else.,178
2,"If you like horror movies, and you liked Hellraiser, you can't go wrong with buying this boxed set of parts 3 thru 8. Well worth the investment for the enthusiasts collection.By the way, keep searching. There is a 9th movie now.",228
2,"We have the mini-series of the beginning and the end of this series, but it left out all explanation of how things got to the end they did. This series fills in all the gaps. It is good Sci-Fi.",193
2,"I got this game since at the time dirt was not out for the ps3 yet and it's not a bad game, The graphics are not bad they look really good for a ps2 game & the in game play is good, If you looking for a really in depth rally game then i think this is not the game for you it's way to simple it's the kind of game you just put in to race and have fun with wean you don't have a lot of time on your hands to play a real simulation game over all buy this game it's simple and fun",476
2,"I ordered the silver one Wed. and recieved it Fri.There is a lot to read, you can't idiot your way through, but it does a lot so I don't mind. Besides, it is really pretty and much more compact than I thought it would be. I am a petite gal who never works out and I was able to lift it. I would have liked more pictures in the instruction manual. I used my rack wrong the first time.",383
2,"This is the best one-volume English language history of Ukraine. If you have to choose between Subtelny's work or Magocsi's, choose Subtelny.",141
2,"I bought this for my son about a month ago, and we LOVE it!!! He loves all the toys and can sit in there for up to an hour! He is a very curious baby and this helps with his curiosity!However this does take a while to assemble and if you're anything like me, the instructions won't help much, lol. But after all the pieces are put together, you'll see how awesome this really is! I just wish I could take this with me on our trips by plane. Anyway, this is a grea buy!",468
2,"I ordered this thing about a month ago. It came in the mail not long after that. I installed it, and it works.",110
2,"The fight scenes were actually realistic. You know Gina can fight in real life, so you don't have that ""she can't do that"" thing going. Three Hollywood A listers and a bonifide female action star. Gina's acting wasn't bad. It wasn't great either, but this is her first film. And I'm assuming she's had zero acting experience. And the fight scene with young Magnito was awesome! Worth the rent, worth the theater, worth buying as well.",434
2,The mouse pad is working very well it was needed to replace one that had served its purpose. This pad is excellent. Thank you,125
2,"I ordered the book having read it already, just to have it for my library. It has a beautiful geometric pattern cover, which looks better on the computer screen than in real life. I prefer the hard-cover edition, but this one will make a nice, inexpensive, but meaningful gift.",277
2,I think that Sookie needs to think about packing her bags and heading west to escape all of the problems thanked getting thrown in her way. She has survived so much and I am so curious to see what she is going to get into next!,227

2,"Husband? Check. Kids? Check. School books? Check. Soccer equipment? Check. Holy water, crucifix, and stilleto knife? Whoops, knew I'd forgotten something!Carpe Demon, and the sequel California Demon, are enjoyable reads that kept me turning the pages long past bedtime. Kate is witty and authentic, and her struggles are so very real. Her family and friends are quirky and fun. A great book to read under a blanket during the winter snow or rain.",446
2,"I am a baker of artican breads. For convenience in mixing dough I usually end up baking two round artisan loaves at a time and have had problems with too-small, insulated baking sheets. For years I have overlapped two smaller cookie-type sheets. That worked but it meant that one of the loaves had to be baked right over the step where the top sheet ended. The Airbake Mega product solved the problem beautifully. Now both loaves have flat bottoms. It is big enough for two loaves but not so big that air circulation is blocked. A perfect solution.",548
2,"Beautiful book. Cover and art are incredible. Very proud to display in home. This is a great, quick read and this edition is very nice.",135
2,"This album swings from fairly conventional Nashville country, on ""I Love It When She Lies,"" to the bluesy shuffle of ""Green Eyed Girl,"" to folk rock grandeur on ""No Higher Ground."" And it vacillates through this range with panache and spirit. In a music world where mainstream music sets the expectations way too low, Greg Trooper is a smart, artistically ambitious troubadour. I wish we had more recording artists like him.",424
2,"I thought the book was well written and funny at the beginning, but at the end it became a little agravating. His humor used at the end came at the wrong times and kind of made your stomach turn. The book began as a light and funny comedy, but turned a touch revolting. The ending and beginning made up for it though so I gave it a 4 out of 5.",343
2,"After enjoying his ""Greatest Hits"" video and DVD for years, I was was concerned that this might be a disappointment. But was pleased to watch ""Hot August Night"" It may be his best. Keep it up Neil.",197
2,"Loved the campy horror movie from the 80s...who knew it was based on such a dark and well written story. This is a surprising little gem of a novel...quickly read and ""absorbed"" if you will...gives a much more believable backstory that the movie ever attempted. A nice find after all these years...give it a try and be pleasantly rewarded...search for both titles in your local used bookstores...I found mine under Lifeforce...",427
2,"Let me preface by saying that even if the movie sucked, Dafoe's performance alone would make it worth watching. He is brilliant.Anyhow, the concept of the movie is really great. A crazy director want to make the ultimate realistic vampire film... and does so by having a real vampire play an actor playing the vampire; in return for the right to eat the lead actress after filming is over.The movie itself is well done, but sometimes feels a little bogged down. The cast is strong however, and its easy to let such problems slide.",530
2,"I rated this movie 4 stars only because, while being a very big fan of Bette Davis, I found the story of this movie a bit too ""soap Opera"". I love Bette most when she plays more profond and serious roles like in the ""The Corn is Green"". I found the later absolutely exceptional.",278
2,"everything was as I expected and the product worked great and arrived in good shape, on time, and did the job I needed it to do",127
2,"These are cute dolls and very sturdy. Perfect for the younger crowd, since at their low price but good quality, you don't have to keep track of the bits and pieces. However, the hair does get frizzy fast. Not much styling possible before all the grease (?) has been stripped off and the hair gets really dry. The outfits are cute, the accessories are fun, too. Can't beat the price.",382
2,"This cookware is on the heavy side, but no where near as heavy as cast iron! The heavy bottom provides even heating, and with the stainless steel lids you never have to worry about the glass lids chipping and getting glass in your food. I for one will never have cookware with glass lids! Being stainless steel, yes you will have problems cleaning it, but put water in the cookware and boil it and the stuck on food comes off easier.",433
2,"Chain linking drives and having a separate power cord on each drive wasn't an option, so this was the best way to go and it does what it says about 90% of the time. Overall I'm happy, not ecstatic but happy enough. Really wish my computer had 6 built in fire wire jacks.",270
2,My son is absolutely in love with his bus! It's the perfect size for his little hands. It is hands-down his favorite toy right now.,131
2,Overall I am happy with this purchase. I got this to put in a krafts room and it has been really useful so far. Would definitely buy again.,139
2,"This is a ""new"" copy for me of a previous cookbook that was too worn to keep. I've used the cookbook for years. Basic recipes, lots of casseroles, desserts, etc.",161
2,"Love that Corelle for everyday use, very durable and stays looking pretty. We occasionally break pieces and I'm grateful to find replacements on Amazon. I have tried to use other dinnerware, but believe this is the best product for us and keep coming back to Corelle. This pattern is not readily available in the stores now that it has been available for sometime.",364
2,"I've used this for a couple of weeks now so I could power my GPS at the same time I was listening to my satellite radio. For the most part, this works fine. The one problem that I've had a few times is that one of the 2 items plugged in may not be drawing power. Sometimes the connection seems loose, although I've never had a problem with the adapter coming loose from the socket itself. While it's not perfect, it gets the job done for me.",441
2,"This was my first Virginia Kantra book & I loved it! This book had two great lead characters, a good storyline & some humor. I really enjoyed Lexie & Jack. I look forward to Ms. Kantra's next book!",197
2,"We've been great fans of this line of glassware ever since we visited the factory where they are made in Austria. The way the glass is made is perfect for sending the wine in the right spot in your mouth for full flavor appreciation. We prefer the Wine series over the other, and more expensive series, because of its square stem. You feel like you have a better hold on the glass while twirling the wine to develop the flavors.",428
2,I bought this shirt in February 2008 and so far it's holding up well. I bought both black and cardinal and the colors are still dark and the buttons still in place. I only wish I would have stocked up if I'd known these would hold up so well.,242
2,These gloves work for there specific purpose I've had them for only two months and the strap is starting to tear. If you are into serious competition these aren't the gloves for you but for getting in shape and basic weightlifting they work fine.,246
2,The tenon cutter works very smoothly. I hadn't used logs as building materials until now and these tools made it a great thing to work with. I built a large arbor as my first project and I couldn't imagine trying to use any other tool. I purchased two cutters and will be purchasing others.,290
2,"this is a very pretty pouch, and looks pretty well made. however, i had to take off a star because mine is a little smaller than the 6x9 listed (which i should have measured out before buying - it's definitely smaller than i was picturing in my head). also, the pockets could use more separation. my earrings will be grating against each other inside the pocket.",362
2,"I realize that not everyone has a corny type of sense of humor like I do where you find silly movies like naked gun or nacho libre just full of laughs ..And Im not the type to rank movies but if you like those type of comedies im sure you will love weekend at bernies ..i literly couldnt stop laughing ..the plot, the scheming is so far out there it truly has 90 min of laughs and its a really enjoyable movie ..I dont usally buy movies anymore but I had to on this one..bottom line either way buy or rent it its a must see """,525
2,"The blue-cover version of this album *IS* in fact better, as it included such classics as ""Beat Box"", ""Moments in Love"" and ""Close (to the Edit)"". However, these songs were licensed from ZTT/Island, and I guess something went wrong. So on this re-release we get tracks from ""Below the Waste"" and ""FON Mixes"" to take their place. Not a bad collection, but not what it was.",371
2,"I've long been a fan of the Judds and Wynonna, and remember the day this album came out. Wy felt a lot of pressure releasing her first solo album, but I feel she lived up to it.I have all the Wy albums, but this is the one I keep reaching for. Her voice is powerful and passionate, and there's a song for nearly every mood, from jamming out to ""No One Else on Earth"" to a more soulful ""Gonna Live with Jesus."" If you listen closely, you'll hear Naomi accompany her on ""When I Reach the Place I'm Goin'.""I highly recommend this album. You won't be disappointed.",560
2,"I first saw this book while staying at a friend's house. The book was placed on the guestroom bedside table. Reading a couple of the little essay-style devotionals was a lovely way to end a day, so I bought a copy of the book to put in my own guestroom to offer the same peaceful ending to my guests' days.",306
2,"I bought this item to use as a mild chemical peel, but happily discovered that it works well in controlling new acne breakout.",126
2,My 5 year old granddaughter really enjoys watching this whole series. She wants to watch them over and over. They all seem to have great lessons and messages for kids to learn. This one was good and very entertaining.,217
2,Great price and fast shipping. Not very strong and it's a good every day perfume formy wife. Great for if you have a baby and you don't want to irritate their skin,163
2,"Very complex, creative and compelling. Gets you into the mindset of the time and place. Makes you want to say, ""why didn't I think of that"" when he brings it up a notch. De Bernieres understands what he is writing about. Love all his works.",240
2,"My husband and me enjoy this movie, even when were out and we make a comment that was from that movie we say it in their context. It's gone McReady.We have always enjoyed this movie.",182
2,THESE WON'T LAST LONG AT THESE PRICES! IF YOU LOVE POTTERY BARN AND OLD NAVY CDS THEN THE BANANA REPUBLIC CDS ARE FOR YOU!,122
2,The Notebook was one of the more enjoyable books I have read in a long time. Despite the sad storyline I found it inspirational that love two people could love one another so much.,180
2,"It's a shame that the public has to dig for the truth rather than rely on the press to be honest, but that's the situation. If you really want to know what was going on rather than buy into the juvenile theory that this was somehow all about W's oil buddies, this is a great start.",281
2,"Blurring the boundaries of punk rock and folk music, TV Smith delivers a powerful cd, full of intelligent lyrics, rich melodies and working-class angst. Unlike most British political punk singers, TV Smith's music is more brooding than growling. This is good music for rainy days, when the world seems bleak, and you just want to sulk...",337
2,"These serving tongs are as big as my grilling tongs, so unless I'm putting my salad in a very large bowl, I can't really use these.",131
2,The product arrived very promptly but could easily have fallen out of the flimsy plastic bag with a big hole in it.,115
2,Keep them coming. What a great read. It is an easy and enjoyable read with all of the characters in this book.,110
2,we got this for our lab and it is wonderful. it works well for us b/c we have a yard that is fenced on one side already. we put it in the crawl space and set it up so it would beep at the back of the yard and on the side of the yard that doesn't have a fence. we just set it up today. it took about a 1/2 hour to set up. we put it on level 4 for our lab and it was really strong so i put it back to level 3 and the regular size prongs instead of the long ones. he is getting it quite well! so much easier than digging! worth the price by far!,542
2,"I'm also 33 years old but my parents actually had the LP of this great album. (What's a CD?) However it's been collecting dust for 25 years since it's too worn out to listen to. Plus, where is that darned old record player anyway! After recently acquiring this LP on CD, trust me, you'll be glad to hear this fine ""tribute to the best"" in true 21st century hi-fi sound (CD quality). Oh yeah, the songs are all good to, but I've loved this album since the '70s. Ahh Haa.",469
2,"Once activated, it killed the rat that was living in our garage within hours. The rat was huge and unlike previous kills with regular ol' rat traps ---this one was clean :) Just brought it inside the house today (early afternoon) cause I spotted a mouse, 2 have been killed by now (midnight). I hope there aren't more in here, but I am getting me another one for the kitchen. This thing works!",393
2,"Nice carrier. Quite impressively made, seems very sturdy and tough, although I have not had the chance to try it out yet, but from what I can tell should work as a wonderful on board carrier for a puppy (which is what I am planning for) or a very small dog (like a chihuahua).",276
2,This book was very helpful. I recommend it to all women. I think men would benefit from it as well.,99
2,"Many a book has excited me into further exploration, but this is the first book that made me change my life. This is an autobiography that tells of one man's journey to find God and what that meant to him in the early 1900's. The irony is that his journey led him to knowledge of the human body that scientifically holds true today. Yogananda's teachings are extensive, and you will only glean a little piece in the Autobiography, but it is the basis for all of his teachings. Enjoy",482
2,I have watched this video over and over and over again. Since I bought it for my 3 1/2 year old son who doesn't want to watch anything else. He loves the animals and the star and the singing. The story is completely entertaining and lighthearted and I think that Marie Osmond does a terrific job as the narrator and the Star.,325
2,"Its a classic! They've taken a classic Zorro movie and made it very funny. I never thought that George Hamilton would pull off 2 roles of Zorro, one straight and one gay so well. Its one movie that that my entire family enjoys watching.",236
2,I didn't they gave me this book. It was a lot of pages that was boring but hey the good part about it was I got smart yah! I am a genus. If wanna be a genus read this book but that is all I have to say about this I mean it is not a book it is a really long dictionary I ever read before.,287
2,"As a casual investor, I never realized all of the opportunities I had been missing, or very simply how my naivete had placed me at a disadvantage in the equities markets. I find it hard to believe that some of the practices which are conducted today by some of the larger brokerage firms are legal, albeit not ethical. Who could ask for more than a level playing field?",369
2,Excellent gift. It is very useful. My dad love it and use it for every thing. It is a excellent tool,100
2,This book wrapped up the story of Napoleon & Josephine very well. I found myself truly caring what happened to this couple. The only drawback was the fact that the author didn't go into Josephine's life toward the end--the book just ended and then there was a postscript. I would highly recommend the entire series.,315
2,"Set-up took about 30 minutes including hauling the empty box to the garage. (use an HDMI cable if you can) Picture is GREAT. I have Comcast so I had the current Motorola DVR with the HDMI connection and my account was HD enabled.Eagle Logistics (Amazon's freight company for out here (CA) did just fine. I tracked the shipment and called the local terminal to arrange delivery before they called me. be proactive.Good product, good delivery.",441
2,"Nice stand, especially it's all in one piece! I agree with most reviewers that the music holder does not hold its position - adding a split washer fixes the problem.",165
2,This was an emotional charged movie. It did answer a question that I had regarding the reason for the separation of church and state in Mexico. Mexico is a highly religious country and I couldn't remember why the separation. Gracias.,233
2,"The dogs love it, but it chews down too fast and doesn't last long enough for what it costs to buy.",99
2,"When you give in and buy the product that costs around $300.00, you will get the real thing. I have watched every disc and they all work perfect. It is a lot of money, but if you want the real deal and don't want to get ripped off, than this is the version to purchase.",269
2,This product fit the bill when I wanted to get a zune docabale sound system. I was a little concerned about sound quality but in the end this system really surprised me. I used it during my new years party and some people were trying to figure out where the extra speakers were placed. It filled the room nicely with sound.,323
2,"A good reminder of things I knew combined with new insights, approaches and tools. An inspirational and practical guide for employees, managers, organization development consultants and coaches. Easy to read and packaged in a practical format.",243
2,"Love these! Definitely get the Ultra Soft over the Hold & Stretch. These are still supportive & thick, but super soft & silky feeling. Go bigger on the sizing, especially with height. I got the XXL, I'm 5'9, size 10.",216
2,"Mine is a little paler than pictured, with darker markings, so the appearance is not as uniform. Tacky green felt comes off with the slightest provocation. I chose this over the RSVP grey one because this is a little smaller and I really wanted to be able to nestle in the palm of one hand, which it does fairly well because it has no pedestal base.",349
2,"I would recommend this book to anyone. It was a little drawn out in parts, but overall it was well written and a good, encouraging read.",136
2,I connected it to my new dehumidifier and it works like a hose!It does seem to be good quality hose and couplings.,114
2,This cd is fantastic...A must have for 2004. Brandy is back and in a big way...An Amazing cd. Everyone should go out and cop it.,128
2,"Excellent adaptation of the classic book, that gives a voice to creatures in a new and startling way. It helps to love horses, but this viewpoint will speak to animal lovers, and help impress on young children the importance of pet responsibility. After all, as the main character clearly says, all animals have no choice, and no voice.Better that we should care for them even more diligently. The film clearly brings out how an animal suffers, if their care is neglected, even once. Very instructive, and highly recommended for all ages.",538
2,"Although the description doesn't say so, this will work on Honeywell damper control for wood furnaces. Very simple installation and a very reasonable cost. Purchased from Patriot through Amazon. Hassle free transaction, just the way online shopping should be.",259
2,"What can i say about the levellers..... They rule... Nuff said.This CD comes with a booklet on the uk & europe zeitgeist tour 95-96. And a craaazy hologram-type-cover-effort that makes it like you are actually at the gig if u wiggle it about in time to the music, its quite battered.14 Sweet tracks, nice version of the boatman/3friends, dijeridoo sounds xtra xcitin",366
2,Great movie about the glorious year of 1999 in Dallas Stars hockey. This has been something nice to watch while waiting for this stupid lockout to end.,151
2,"I was amazed and suprised at this book...it takes you through a large range of emotions. I was truly angry while reading the beginning of the novel, only to find myself sobbing and smiling at the end. Mr. Patterson definately did a wonderful job.",246
2,"This CD is simply great. Jack Johnson is the most accomplished surfer/musician ever. If you like Ben Harper, get this album. Harper even makes an appearance on the album playing the slide guitar. This is a top-notch product.",224
2,I just purchased 2 EPSON C88+ printers. They print text great. I use them daily. They have low resolution for photos. Colors could be a little brighter. Easy to use.,165
2,"This was a favorite of mine already when it first came on TV. Short, funny vignettes, usually with cute, sexy ideas.",116
2,Great book. This one is a must have. It surely fits my top 3 next to Pit Bull and Darvas' book.You either like him or hate him but you can't argue with his record...,165
2,"the hernia belt does work . I am on my third day but there are adjustments , you will have too address and in my case some major modifications. one of the reviews suggested to buy on the large side and I did . I am 41"" on the fence between med and large so on the recomendation I chose the large. now I am forced to take about 4"" out of the belt",345
2,"Very solid movie. Well done, well acted. Dark, sad and a bit hard to watch in parts, but they did a good job with the ""handheld"" camera style without giving you motion sickness. Not the kind of movie I'd want to watch again right after finishing it, but I'd definitely put it in the ""must watch at least once"" column.",317
2,I studied it for a few months and still need more time. it is a lot of information. I passed by a 55.,101
2,"Came within two days. Very easy to hook up. So far (2 months) it is working quite well. It is a little noisy and makes you wonder if it will be able to load paper, but it does. Printing is pretty fast and the fax worked well on both receiving and sending.",255
2,"I own 2 of these keyboards. The first one I used for three years before the ""v"" key stopped working...I never realized how much we use the letter v until that day. Anyway, the second is still going strong. I like the gentle curve over the more radical ergo keyboards.",267
2,"As a trombonist, I bought this to adjust the screw at the end of my water key which has a habit of coming loose. It's small and compact, so it fits in my case nicely and works great!",182
2,The mask was exactly what was promised and it is very comfortable to wear! I may have to purchase another one after I use this for a few weeks !,144
2,This is an outstanding book. What a refreshing perspective on raising girls in today's society. This book is full of practical ways to communicate God's values to your daughter. It will also help me in raising my son to value and appreciate women!,247

2,"you have the best price .seen this book at the store and they wanted more money for it.a friend told me to go to amazon and thats what i did ,so thank you",154
2,"This film was slammed in the UK and buried by the makers Channel 4 because it was felt that it portrayed gay men in a negative way. Yes, it's dark and at times pretty sad but I think it's a very honest portrayl of modern gay life in London. It challenges many stereotypes and asks lots questions. There are no happy endings but it's a good story well told, beautifully filmed with a great atmosphere. And theres a few good looking lads too. Well worth a look.",459
2,"This is a great read for understanding how ADHD plays into family dynamics and understanding the impact on each member. I recommend this book for anyone with ADHD in their family, counselors, therapists, and social workers or those who work with families struggling with ADHD.",276
2,"I alternately loved and hated this book. bell hooks makes me angry, but this book challenged my mind and my thinking. This is a must read for anyone seeking a solid foundation in feminist theory and writing. hooks explains the challenges facing black feminists like no one else can. While at times I do find flaws in her assumptions and logic, pushing the limits is the only way to secure positive change.",405
2,"This book gave me flash backs to when I lived at home with my family in Mungret Co. Limerick. A good Irish family taking care of each other and all that goes with it e.g. caring, crying, fighting, laughing, loving and all the rest - all in all a GREAT read",256
2,"I bought the DVD because I knew I enjoyed the movie. I also liked the supplemental info (with Hitchcock's daughter)--hadn't seen that before; Daughter said it was ""Hitch's"" favorite movie because in it evil is brought to a nice little town and family. Good characters, plot, and humor. Good quality DVD.",303
2,"Although the I agree w/the previous review to a point, the many flavors that this product comes in have helped me GREATLY through my crazy-crunch attacks! Yes, they have a unique taste at first, but I'm oddly attracted to these critters now! I say to give 'em a try...I'm addicted.",281
2,"I read World Stompers and also enjoyed that book. Eventhough this book does not have photo's(I'm a Photojournalist) it is a great piece of work. I would have listed a few more places than in the book, but still fantastic work.I have been to many of the places listed in this book and his description is 95% on track.Zentravel",325
2,"Simply superb - the acting, the screenplay. The set was simple and there were no CGI whatsoever. But the movie is so intense, engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable.",162
2,"I had these on for a long flight that I recently took. I used them for my IPOD and for listening to DVDs on my lap top. They are the most comfortable head phones I have ever owned. The headphones have noise reduction which blocked out the sound of the plane's engine and a kid crying behind me, without me having to blare the volume to dround out those sounds. I wore the headphones just to not hear the other plane noises even when I wasn't listening to music or dvds. Love 'em.",479
2,"This book is a quick read. I read it in a matter of a few hours. The main character, Jerry Brudos, is repulsive and disturbing. Ann Rule does a fantastic job of telling his sick and twisted story. There were times when I felt a queasiness in my stomach. If you easily have nightmares, read this during the daytime. A real spine tingler!",336
2,"This show is awesome. I love the actors, they do an excellent job. Johnny Lee Miller does a wonderful job as Sherlock.",118
2,"Very easy to wash. Not as thick as I thought they would be, but am still satisfied. Does not require a lot of cooking spray. Overall I enjoy this product.",154
2,"When the film was first released, a lot of people didn't understand it. It was like other films they had seen before, just a rehash of older material. Wrong! It was a Terrentinoesk homage to a Horror films. Yes, there were the Jock, Blonde, Stoner, Slut characters, but they are there for a reason. Watch the film, especially the background story.",347
2,"These stickers are perfect for my ESL kids. The colors are bright & attractive, the adhesive really sticks, and the scents add novelty. They are a good value for the price.",172
2,"this is great music. coming from an avid ""serious"" jazz fan who does not understand a word of spanish. this is a ""must buy"" for all the gringos out there. i am very very impressed w/ the writing, arrangement and the vocal. this shows some serious work from the entire production staff. too bad i can't understand spanish. by the way, i think this CD is to the level of Alejandro Sanz's ""Mas"". by the way, any Cristian fans out there who cares to advise me which is better? ""mi vida sin tu amor"" or ""azul"", his latest release?",525
2,"I finally have my own copy of "" THE State"" forever. THis is an amazing group of actors, comedians! These people no how to make you laugh and laugh and want to pee your pants. If you like Reno 911, you cant say no to this! ""What are we gonna do with all this pudding"" Looks like you will have to buy this box set to find out!!!!",327
2,"I've probably read over 100 musician biographies and autobiographies. So far, this is the best. It almost reads like a letter from a friend. It's candid and honest, with Smokey's talent for words sprinkled throughout. You can hear the music in his thoughts.There are more than enough names and dates to satisfy ones need for the events of Smokey's life, but they're embraced by his words. I couldn't put it down.I'll be seeing Smokey in concert on 08/11, and I'm certain that this book will only bring me closer to the man on stage.Enjoy!",538
2,"I read this years ago and still remember Professor Fall's excellent book. It spawned an interested in the affairs of the region which lead me to learn much more history and to read his other books. Anyone interested in Vietnam, military history or our involvement there should begin with this and it will lead them to other fine books.",335
2,I bought this book for my 4 year old Grandaughter but I must admit I enjoy reading the stories so much that when she asks for it again and again I have no problem with that. Dora teaches great lessons and does it with such fun that they don't even know they are being taught. Great book and I am so glad I bought it - you will be too.,334
2,"There are so many great tracks on this CD, but if only for ""A Certain Smile"", you should buy it...this track alone is worth it.",127
2,"I've been using this router for years and it has never given me problems. The setup is easy and the maintenance is non-existent. The signal is strong enough to get to my Xbox 360, which is downstairs and across the house.What's so amazing is that while my computer and its components get replaced every few years, this little workhorse has stayed with me through it all.Highly recommended.",389
2,"Attached to our Sony LCD HDTV, It makes the sound of watching movies, lisening to music and watching sports - great. We like the compack design & ease of connecting.",165
2,"She Flew the Coop is one of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time. I suppose some of my appreciation for the book can be credited to having a mother from the South. The characters were all very vivid and remind me of people I've known. Despite the tragedy associated with the main character, Olive, the story has an upbeat ending with people getting what they deserve",382
2,"The Triple Concerto is a beautiful masterpiece and this rendition and recording is quite stunning. The 10th Symphony, though less well-known and perhaps less a masterpiece, is also quite appealing. Any Beethoven fan would be happy to own this CD.",246
2,"The flower detail is beautiful! The thread count feels real nice after you wash it. Great price, too!",101
2,"I got this book at the local college bookstore for a class I am taking of beginning Chinese (hanyu). I use it on tests along with my dictionary and I am still surprised that it hasn't been taken away because it is so helpful it's almost like cheating. Almost anytime I can't find a character in my textbook or dictionary, I count the strokes and look up its pinyin in my book. I don't know where I'd be without it. Or how I might survive in Taiwan without it.",459
2,"My wife has allways wanted me to take a multi vitamin but I am not a pill person, Once I found this I have not missed a day yet.",128
2,"This book is a clear, insightful and, yes. brilliant marketing guide. It is suitable for the most experienced and sophisticated business leaders, as well as a primer for business beginners. The author, Celia Rocks, knows her subject and communicates her ideas with detailed examples. Brilliance Marketing Management is innovative and inspiring. I recommend it highly.",367
2,"Read it in one sitting. I need to read it again to pick up the subtle details in narrative. The conversation style that many have commented on is done to reflect the condition of these two people. Starving, physically weak and emotionally damaged by the horrors they witness on their journey. Recommended read.",310
2,"I will start out by saying that this gun is not for expirienced players. This gun is good for me because im not an intense player. If you use 12g bb it will shot about how far a spring pistol does, but if you use a 24g bb it wail shoot 215fps. i use 12g bb. if you play in a backyard then this is a gun to get.",310
2,Great product. It was for my wife's birthday and she has two tuxedo cats. It was hung on the wall within minutes. Very attractive. Delivery was swift.,150
2,"This is a good Christmas movie. One of those ""The Grass isn't always greener"" kind of movies that gets you thinking.",116
2,"Great read in my Leadership class, some of the content was outdated but concepts were still valid. Would definitely recommend.",126
2,"My husband searched for years to find any ladder without plastic on top. Welding spatter melts right through plastic tops and sometimes erupts in flames! Problem solved. Strong aluminum top, sturdy 2 sided ladder for more productive setup and working completes the job more efficiently! Its a little bit heavy but that's an acceptable trade off for sturdiness.Only con with ladder- After 10 years or more the fiberglass is starting to becomeweathered from being in the sun and ultraviolet light from welding and is very itchy when touched with skin!",549
2,"I have to be honest, I haven't done much more than leaf through this magazine and look at the pictures. I have been too busy for the past six weeks or so. I will say that some of the stuff looks yummy, so I have saved them and plan to dive back in when life slows down.",269
2,"This was possibly one of the best groups to play in the 90s. Unfortunately, they broke up before they produce their second album. If only they would magically appear on stage again, I'm sure that the world would accept them back in the spotlight of the music industry. Maybe we'll all be blessed that one day they will get back together again and grace our ears with their music.",379
2,"This movie is a brilliant scary movie spoof! It has a mystery, lots laughs, and some chills. There are some corny parts--but in a good way. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh.",203
2,I just seen this book in my roommates room and I became curious. I grabbed it and starting reading it to see how well it might help. With carefully reading this book I was able to recite all 50 states and in order. This book links words and thoughts of images that all relate to each other. I recommend this book if you would like to learn of different techniques to help improve memory. This just needs to be practiced often so it can become long term use.,457
2,"This is a terrific disc, good recorded sound, nice instrument by Clementi's piano company, and interesting music also, which is seldom recorded.Amazon - please fix the description however, it is Clementi (Composer), John Khouri (Performer), not ""Busoni; Godowsky (Composer), Carlo Grante (Performer)"".",301
2,"I thought I liked s'mores before I tried making them with these cookies. If you haven't already tried them you need to, so good!",128
2,The pen arrived on time and was packaged extremely well. When setting up my tablet to recognize the pen new software appeared that allowed me to customize more than I had before. I suspect my old pen would have done the same but I never bothered to look.The pen is working well for my work in 3D Studio Max as well as Premiere Pro. It seemlessly detects which program I'm in and allows me to use the functions I need.,417
2,"One of the most entertaining novels I've read in a long time. Beautifully evocative of a magical time and place - a stunning fusion of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and James Clavell's ""Shogun."" It's refreshing to read an adventure story where the female characters are just as strong and capable as their male counterparts.I very much look forward to reading the next book in the series.",391
2,This was bought because she is going thru chemo and goes to our indoor pool at the club house for exercise.She liked the visor and the sentiment that went with it.,163
2,I purchased this case to use with a 1TB Toshiba portable hard drive. Overall the case is well made and well designed if you want to carry two portable drives. I currently have both the Toshiba drive and a Western Digital Passport in the case. I guess in the long run it saves me from buying another case but it really is too big for most portable drives (my lacie rugged drive does not fit).,391
2,"I used to have all of these on VHS. Now that I got them on DVD, I can enjoy them better with brighter color and better sound quality. Shipment was fast and great. No damage to the case what so ever and the DVDs never moved off the holders inside like those you get from stores.",277
2,"I am glad I read this. I tend to usually not get into reading plays, but I did enjoy this one. It is haunting and is not a feel-good read, much like the movie. However, there are some lines in this that just grab you. The constant question of what defines love, sex, and happiness is very thought-provoking. Can love just stop in a single moment?",346
2,This is an awsome CD I hightly recommend it. All of the songs on this CD are great.,83
2,I really like this unit. The rollers have great clamps that make them stay on. It is compact for travel also.,109
2,"I bought this roaster a few years ago from home shopping,the price was only 39.00 at the time. great product....chicken comes moist...but I would not pay 159.00.Its cheaper somewhere else I'm sure.",197
2,"This book really helped me to learn more than a few things about coding in AS2. Thanks so much for the tips,",108
2,"I have never had a problem using the Verbatim DL discs. They prove to be very reliable (over my 3 years of experience with them.)The last batch I bought was a 30 spindle and it was 8X speed, I ran them reliably at 6X. I do not see anything on the label of 96577 that states its reliable at 2.4-6X (my packaging states 2.4X only) I have been running them at 2.4 which slows the burning process a little.I may have received the tail-end of older stock? I just don't know. The discs preform well.",493
2,"After my one and only trip to a well know tax preparation service that left me quite unimpressed, I decided the next year to use Turbo Tax and have been using Turbo Tax ever since. So far it has helped me understanding and handling inheritance, mortgage and even a side business. I've been a little disappointed of late to see the company move away from their original willingness to stand behind their product if users were audited, to an additional service fee. About my favorite feature is the option to create a PDF file for your tax return.",545
2,"A priest gave me an earlier version of this book years ago. I have subsequently purchased many for students in a theology seminar that I have mentored for twelve years. The book is divided into chapters that work perfectly as a week's assignment for any bible study group. Each chapter includes artwork, poems or hymns, biblical passages, and essays on various aspects of prayer. This book is truly a spiritual delight.",419
2,Christopher's done it again! Fabulous book! It helps you look at decorating in a whole new light. It's fun and fresh. If you love Christopher Lowell this book is a must have!,174
2,"Hi, I've been using this memory in my toshiba a75 and the difference is awesome. I feel i have a new computer... Great product.Recommended 100%",143
2,"I love Midsomer Murders. It's mystery, adventure and comic relief rolled into one. I can't wait for Set 13 to come out because the U.S. channels have quit showing the series. It's a shame because it was one of the best series on American TV. Since it's available on DVD, I'll be able to see the episodes they did not show on television. I put Chief Inspector Barnaby right up there with Inspector Morse. British murder mysteries are great.",439
2,A fine movie about a unique individual.Today's movies do not come anywher near the quality of these older filmsIt is a pleasure dealing with Amazon. Prices are reasonable. Delivery is prompt,190
2,It took a month from the shipping date to receive this boxset but it was well worth it - they do warn you when booking that it could take this long - read all these as a child and the presentation box and souvenir editions are a lovely reminder and keepsake!,258
2,"Not even in the same class as her historical romances like Whitney, etc. but very entertaining. Not much romance as I would have liked, but it was a great listen (Audio Book while I drive) and you end up getting sucked into the story and Mitchell and Kate's love story. Typical McNaught misunderstandings cause some frustration, but as always it's worth it in the end.",368
2,"Sula, a book that talks about the issues of being a black women is a really good novel to read.One of the reasons I recommend it is because of its realism and its themes - death, sex, friendship and poverty.I also think that its characters are very good, its easy to identify with one or both of them. I really recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature.",368
2,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who has read about Zen, or is up on the theories of paying positive attention to NOW. It provides the practical advice on how to pay attention, even in the middle of a modern western life. It's done wonders for my peace of mind (2 small children can divide anyone's attention). There's not a lot of discussion of theory, or why Zen and attention are good or important, simply a lot of ways to achieve them. Highly recommended.",462
2,"I not one to write reviews but I really, really liked this book! I wasn't sure I even wanted to read it but the reviews got my attention and I couldn't put it down once I stated it. I have the other 2 books in the series on order now. A very good book!",252
2,"I didn't buy it as a toy, bought it for my wife and she likes it, my daughter plays with it once in a while but she is not into Fraggle rock yet. It looks very durable.",168
2,I was very impressed with the plot of Thief in the Dawn. My heart pounded as I traveled the frighning journey of Mandie in the Florida Keys. It was truley a suspensful love story that kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. The steamy love scenes and building supense were very well done in this authors first novel.,333
2,I am speechless........ this movie is superb.I have been waiting 2 years to see this movie and it was well worth the wait.Seeing the movie for the first time just makes you want to cry (the trailers dont do it justice) its just so cool!,236
2,"Well, This following the essential 50's and 60's, is a excellant representation of the Kings final decade, from tear jerker ballads, to country, to pure rock n roll, This time period is ofte underrated, but produced many great songs for the King.An Awsome live disc displays some killer tuens and great versions of classic songs, definatly a must!!",348
2,"I bought the stand used but when it came it looked brand new. It tilts a little, but other than that it is a sturdy professional stand.",135
2,"I usually get the white chocolate chocolate bars but mis-clicked and got these instead. It was a good change of pace.The chocolate crunch was good and chocolatey. I don't always have time for lunch and they filled in very well with a high protein ""desert"" instead of normal food.I like all of the non-sugar think thin products that I have tried.",345
2,"I'm fairly sure this CD is the same as the original LP, which was released around 1967. After over 40 years I still remember that the end of the LP contained a medley of Mancini's themes, which were beautifully arranged and performed. I hope this CD is going to be re-issued at a reasonable price someday. As I recall, Mancini conducted the Philadelphia Pops for recording the LP.",380
2,Nicely made set. They are perfect for my uses in wax or clay... I have looked for years for something like these... Nicely made set.,132
2,"I'm very happy with this GPS because of It's simplicity of use and response is perfect. It is not the best GPS but for common people who sometimes travel is great! The Bluetooth with my nokia's 6311 and 5800 worked perfect. Speed of connection with satellite here in my country 7 out of 10.I think It have two cons:1. The external antenna makes it uncomfortable to manage, and seems to be very sensible.2. Lack of the function to save the route.",445
2,"There is not much to add to what has been written by previous reviewers, except to point out that the prison guard was expendable by the Zantis because he was of ""the same spoiled persuasion"". Social commentary here on our own prison guards.",241
2,"Schwensen's business-like nature is sometimes annoying. He name-drops a lot and fawns over the genius of Carrot Top, offering as evidence of his creativity the fact that he makes money. But if you can supply the artistry, Schwensen definately knows the business. He has a lot of direct, useful information about how to market your act at all levels of competition, from novices to headliners.",392
2,"This was a great era for the electric band. I really like this show, especially the instrumentals ""Embryonic Journey"" and ""Water Song."" Very energetic ""Big R&R Blues"" too. So many highlights. This is a show worth owning.",220
2,"Carrot, Vimes, Colon, Nobbs are back. With also alot of new recruits:Angua, Detritus and Cuddy. What is the mysterious thing killing dwarfs, clowns and assasins? Is Vimes finally going to get married? Who knows?",211
2,"It works pretty well. However, the only drawback is that I have not seen any sort of low battery indicator. As the charge nears zero, it just ends up with static. Clearly (no pun intended) they could have done something to better indicated low battery (indicator LED on the outside of the unit could blink red, warning tone, etc.). However, given the price I paid for the unit, I can live with this shortcoming. Overall, very good purchase and I would buy it again.",465
2,I bought this coffeemaker to replace my Cuisinart which would periodically back up and overflow. I wish I had done it sooner! The Zojirushi makes a very good cup of coffee. It takes long enough brewing to get full flavor and keeps the coffee hot for hours. The #4 filters work perfectly despite what is said in some of the reviews.,331
2,"I had to buy the VX9900 enV without a contract and had it flashed over to my service provider. However, I found that it was impossible to set my mp3 files on a microSD card as ringtones, as I had been able to do previously with my other phone. This product, however, fit perfectly in my phone's USB port and the driver CD included had everything I needed to put those mp3 files on my phone as ringtones. An excellent buy!",421
2,"If you thought Hugh Laurie was just an amazing actor, then you need to read his wonderful first (and hopefully not last) book. The Gun Seller is a suprisingly hilarious, fast-paced, page turner from beginning to end. While I am not normally one for spy novels, this book has changed my thinking on the genre. You'll immediately find yourself rooting for the main character, begging the book gods for a happy ending for this unlikely hero. Laurie's quick wit with words and insane plot twists are golden - I could not have asked for a better read.",546
2,"Annie Hall is a light and whimsical journey through the New York dating game. As usual, Woody Allen pokes plenty of fun at himself and Diane Keaton turns in a great performance.Basically, this is a movie about what it is like for older people to try and date while in New York City. It does not help when the man, Woody Allen, suffers from Social Anxiety Disorder. What follows is good old fashioned fun. It is laugh out loud funny at points, and generally just a feel good movie.This is one that everyone should see.",517
2,"I agreee wholeheartedly with those below. But Mr Ball is not merely a theorist, he supplies a chapter in which he takes us on a brief journey backward through Hamlet for a distance, and through this method shows how single and specific Hamlet's action is. I can't approach a script now without setting up my dominoes and charting it backward. It seemes foolish not to.",368
2,"Theres only 1 review for this version - and i must say - this is the best version. Playstations version didnt hold up to this one - nor the Windows 95 version (yea...old game)anyway, this game got me hooked on the series - until i was sickened by the newer ones (they suck horribly) the graphics were awesome in this game (now, with todays technology - they're laughable) but this game is the original relase, and the best of the series. give this version a try - its a blast.",476

2,"These essays, like his fiction, are written for the reader to enjoy the language, and may be most fun for readers who've read a lot of past and current ""high"" literature. For my money, the best writing on tennis that has ever been written. His writing is to straight nonfiction and realist fiction as writing by Jarrell and Lowell (among others) is to academic poetry criticism: idiosyncratic and expressive of this particular writer's relation to words and culture.",466
2,Works great and is a great thing to have here in Ohio during the winter. =) My girlfriend uses it every time we ride in the car. She even uses it if we are only in the car for 15 minutes... she loves it!,203
2,I THOUGHT HIS LAST DISC WAS PRETTY Good.but this one is Better.it's More Rawer.You Can Hear THE Stevie Wonder&Sly Stone Influence all over this Disc.His Re-Make Of If You Want Me to Stay is Bumping With The GREAT GENIUS OF ROGER TROUTMAN on PRODUCTION.Spiritual Thang is The Cut.He is A Good Lyricist&THE Music Works Really well here.,334
2,"Audioslave is one of the few good merger bands. Taking Chris Cornell and throwing in Rage Against the Machine band members was a great idea. With this album, you get the same great riffs that Rage Against the Machine fans have come to expect, mixed with a different flavor of vocals. While the rapping vocals of RATM's Zach de la Rocha definitely will be missed, Chris Cornell pulls through with his awesome voice.",414

2,"It's so exciting to me when you buy a dvd that you've never heard of, a teacher you've never heard of and it's AWESOME! I loved this dvd for several reasons... it's short, sweet, flows nicely AND it's great instruction. I might not suggest it for the very beginner yogi, but this is a great dvd!TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION",315
2,"I have had many a coffee maker over the years and this is by far the best. I went with Cuisinart as I have been very pleased with previous Cuisinart purchases. They didn't disappoint me this time either. The coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee. It's easy to fill, easy to clean. I was thrilled with my savings over the department store price. Delivery was fast. Overall a positive experience with Amazon and the coffee pot.",428

2,"This is a great printer/copier/scanner, for all the reasons others give here. Easy to operate, performs flawlessly and at a decent speed, scans easily without any fuss, and isn't a toner hog.The only problem with it is that it does not work with the 64-bit version of Windows 7. I just bought a new desktop and found to my dismay that I could not a driver for the MF3110 because of this issue. So buy it if you can find one - but check first to make sure your system is 32 bit.",477
2,"First of all, I got this game for Christmas and I think this is a great game, but I can't make it to the second level of any game. I didn't even know the game had any other levels to a seperate game (Get To Class, Vollyball, ect.) until I researced the game on the inernet!!! I have tried EVERYTHING to get to the other levels of a game, but I just finish the whole game, (to Moped Racer) each seperate game with no extra levels!!",430
2,This book is for dumb headed people who rely mainly on government for hand out and have a victim mentality. This book will enlighten you if you will be open minded to Larry's arguments.,185
2,"While I am a fan of Ms. Potter's books, this third book in the series was not the best of the lot. Usually the third book in a series of three, is always the best since it ties up loose ends carried through the previous books and allows us to find out how the previous books's couples are doing. I just wasn't as excited about the characters. It was still a better-than -average read and I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it. I rate the first two books as 5'sand enjoyed the series as a whole.",501
2,This is the best album I have purchased this year. Hands down. The musicianship on the whole album is flawless. I bought the album and right after listening to it for the first time bought tickets to their upcoming show. If you like metal you will not be dissapointed.,268
2,"This is BUBBLEGUM. But it's not your usual. it's much catchier with better lyrics! (Why ya wanna call me on my phone, every time you see another boy in my home, but boy, you should have thought of that before, now you wanna come home and you're alone, just hte same ol same ol sad scenario, every time you say you wanna be someone, etc.) I can't wait for the album.",365
2,"This movie is amazing. I saw it at the Philidelphia Video Festival last year. Jesus comes back to fight sin in the twenty-first century and encounters a world much different then the way he left it 2000 years ago. Watch him fight the greatest sinners of all time: Richard Nixon, Adolf Hitler, Vlad the Impaler and Jim Morrison.",327
2,"Nicholas Sparks has such a wonderful gift for making a reader feel every emotion possible. I laughed, and mostly cried through this whole book. But don't misunderstand, it was the kind of cry that makes you feel so good afterwards. The spiritual emphasis in this book was something I enjoyed very much. It is going to make a great Christmas gift for all of my friends!",368
2,"Good quality movie-making, excellent, inspiring story. Good character development and story-telling. I appreciated having an inspirational story of contemporary martyrdom.",171
2,I wasn't sure how good the color would be since this film is nearly 75 years old. I shouldn't have worried about it because technicolor holds up very well. This film HAS TO BE close to the images that people saw back in 1936.I'm very pleased with my purchase!,259
2,I make a lot of stews soups and braised recipes. This heavy duty fantastic Lodge Dutch Oven is great for that and it will last a lifetime or two!!! I have made Lamb Shanks in it and Braised Short Ribs it does a beautiful job going from stove top to oven. It comes pre seasoned which is a plus.,293
2,"Shrek: The Whole Story Boxed Set is a great all-in-one solution for Shrek lovers! If you have a love for the Shrek movies and are looking to add them to your dvd collection, consider this boxed set to quickly and economically do so. If you aren't familiar with the Shrek movies, don't be fooled by the cartoon format and assume it is for kids! The humor has subtle adult references that make this fun for all!",409

2,"this is a good product. i like it a lot. it works just like it says it will. and works well. only thing, i wish it would be able to record voice to mp3 format. it is nice how it can record like close to 5 or 8 hours at a time, i haven't tested that though.",256
2,This has always been one of my favorate albums by Neil Young. Highly underrated. Neil is back in full force with Crazy Horse after recording Hawks and Doves. Re ac tor rocks from begining to end and never misses a beat. Great to see it released in CD form now.,260
2,I loved all three books in the trilogy and hope that the author continues the story.,84
2,"a little harder to find in stores and on the internet; but I am so happy with ecover products. Just less 'sanity-like' smells, which seveth generation still makes me wonder how green are their products. This product cleans grease and crust well without having to apply excessive amounts. Like many of ecover products the scent is never overpowering. And also you never have to use a lot, which means it last a long time. thanks ecover.",435
2,I remember watching this movie when i was a kid and when i saw it on blu ray i bought it for my collection if you dont have this movie or never seen it buy it watch it remember it for years to come,197
2,I ordered this for my son before christmas this came quick and works great!! Thanks u so much for everything. I would recommend u to anyone..,141
2,"This double CD set was released in 1990, in honor of legendary Indian composer and musician, Ravi Shankar. The music presented is a beautiful Indian experience, with Mr. Shakar backed up by such worthies as his late son, Shubho, and the late Durga Lal, who died after the concert but before the album was released.The music itself is quiet and reflective, and shows of the great man's talents admirably. If you like good sitar music, then you will love this album - it's a real tour de force, and should be considered a classic.",528
2,"This is a great bike. I've owned it now for about a month and rode it most every day. It looks great and rides great and for the weight and compoinets its a value. The STI shifters cost over 100 dollars. Of course at a bike shop u could find better bikes, but not a road bike, under 500. In short, for the most part and the money this is an outstanding Road Bicycle.",366
2,Just spellbinding. I was enthralled and could not put this one down. Kagan creates characters that are so human. This subject is a very hard one and she handles it with grace.Can't wait for her next book! Keep up the good work.,227
2,This was my first Strange Matter book that i read. It was awesome especially when Karen was talking to the 8 ball and the jester scared the (...) out of me. Strange Matter books emit emotions and have that wierd feeling that you want to read more.Ive been looking for years for Engle And Barnes. These are better than Goosedumps.,329
2,"I picked these up for $10 while waiting for my Sony MDR-XD400's to be repaired. And while the sound of these cannot compare to those, these are amazing considering the price. The bass isn't that strong, nor are they especially loud, but such things cannot be expected from cans at a price like this. I would recommend these to anyone who does not expect audiophile quality from their phones, or if you need decent headphones at a good price.",441
2,"This album just lets us further know how limitless this brother's talent really is. This album has something on it for the young, the not-so-young-anymore, the young-at-heart, and the saints. Broken is a definite must-have for your gospel music library. GO GET IT!!!! and get ready for your blessing!!",301
2,"This movie looks amazing on blu ray. Seeing as how it's also one of the best movies of all time, if you don't own it, you need to get your hands on this. There are some really interesting special features, but more than anything, it looks amazing!",247
2,"A humerous guide for both children and adults. Gives you the history of Crazy Bones, games to play, and listings of the different characters. Needs to be updated to include most recent Bones (like Monster Bones, Dragonball Bones, and Toy Story 2 Bones) but is a good start for most people.",289
2,"this one's the best book to study for the NCIDQ. but they need to make an updated version. i just took the ncidq and items on the test but not in the book were drapery, carpet and wallcovering calculations and sustainable design.",229
2,I use this book because I am under a doctor's care and have to track my food intake and exercise daily. I'm also supposed to take notes on how I feel physically each day. I was happy to find a book that included everything I needed. It's the first one I've found and I've been doing this for a while. I also write my medications down on the journal page after I take them and have them all listed in the front. That way in case of emergency the crew would know what I take. I carry this book in my purse and love it.,516
2,"I fell absolutely in love wid Liquid Paradise when I heard it fo da first time.very techno, very progressive and very Trance!!",126
2,"The only thing I can't figure out is how Sean can sit night after night next to liberal wacko Colmes and not slap him from time to time... anyway,great book!!!",159
2,This was the best book I've read in the historical romance genre. I have yet to read the book that tops this one except more Deborah Simmons. A delightful book that has you turning pages and loving every minute of it. I'd recommend it to anyone with a love for romance.,269
2,"wonderful cd, got here very quickly and in great shape, would definitely buy from this person again",99
2,The idea for the creature(s) is very interesting. The creature looks impressive and is freaky like you would expect. It's an interesting movie and it's one I will watch again. Is it great? No. But it is pretty good.,215
2,"The first (and maybe the only) record I have that has a sticker that says ""parental advisory explicit lyrics"". Though not everyone will enjoy loud belching sounds, I think that this is one of the best renaissance records you can buy.",233
2,I have tried several types of portable MP3 players. This is by far the best. Using WMA format I was able to get about 65 songs on the player. Very durable. Also it is very user friendly. Very easy to transfer music to the player. Don't mess around with any other company.,271
2,This was a great tool to help calm our squirmy baby - who would keep himself up most of the night moving around. I read Happiest baby on the block - where swaddling was encouraged. It was magical - I didn't go anywhere without our swaddles. This particular one was easy to use and convenient.,292
2,"I bought these for my brother that is a piolet, and he loved them. Recommended to buy with polarized lens, you can tell the difference.",135
2,"Like other readers, I was a bit put off by the handful of characters all thrown at me at once. I had to refer to the family tree provided more than once. At one time, I put down the book, crying, This is insane! And then I got it. It is insane. Okay. I read Marquez, I get it. Once you stop wrestling with the story, trying to fit it into a conventional fiction mold, you can loosen up and enjoy the ride. Ms. Garcia is such a talented writer she can get away with anything.I recommend this book without reserve.Enjoy!",518
2,"Though I can't say it's a great book for a beginner, I can say it had some pretty good ideas for a more seasoned Sculpey artist/crafter.",136
2,These are very nice. Thick and soft. I like them better than the Gerber washable pads. And it comes with a small laundry bag which is added plus.,145
2,"I am a fourteen year old girl, and this book is my most favorite EVER. This is a VERY high compliment, seeing that I read a LOT and have read a LOT of books and THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. Read. Read. That's all I have to say. Read.",256
2,This cd is an excellent addition to anyone who owns and loves the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials. My children loved to hear the music from the shows they had watched.,166
2,"Who doesn't love a classic? The only thing I missed were the pictures, but I read it to my girls Christmas eve and they loved it!",129
2,"I first saw this movie when I was about 12,I was just like the deadend kidsI loved Rocky Sullivan and I was crushed when Rocky went to the chair and turned Yellow! It was the first time a ending broke my heart!I did not want to believethat Rocky would turn yellow,but I was not quite sure if he was faking because of the deadend kids! Stll not sure!",349
2,"This product is great. The last Lincoln grease gun was 13 years old, and it finally broke. The only problem we run into is the casters are not big enough, but this is just our application. We installed bigger casters. We use this product daily, at a Caterpillar dealership, so it gets tested very well. Would recommend.",319
2,"The transfer was almost 100% good with only one minor flaw in one brief scene. It also included some scenes not found in the original US release, which made the flick even more interesting. Jill Ireland is featured and Telly Savalas played a fine supporting role.",263
2,"Ludlum has put together a very good plot. Problem is, the dialogue is just ridiculous for the first hundred or so pages. Don't give up on it. The story unfolds at a good clip, with only a couple parts that make you wonder about the characters' intelligence. As with all of Ludlum's heroes, Drew Latham is practically superhuman in ability, but that is acceptable because the story is really outstanding. If you really like Ludlum, it is worth reading this book. There is some vintage Ludlum action and twists, not quite enough, but it is there. Read it.",553
2,This is a new artist for country music. I really enjoy his music the songs are easy to listen to and I hope to hear alot more from him in the future!,149
2,Has a nice assortment of her hits with a couple that you cant get on any other albums im aware of.,98
2,I use this for my Canon 1000D and could not be happier. It has plenty of storage capacity for a long weekend of heavy shooting. Purchase two of these for the price. Have had no problems in 6+ months of heavy use. Would purchase again.,234
2,"I purchased this set and was alarmed to find two View to a Kill, one in the place of where Octopussy was supposed to be. Also, found it $20 cheaper at Costco. Always shop around before you make the committment. As for quality, some are definite blu ray but others I dont notice it.",281
2,"I have two dogs, a basset and a corgi, and they are total chewers. If they don't have something to chew on then they're running around the house like little mini-tornadoes. They don't like rawhide chips, get bored of unflavored bones, and are only occupied for ten to fifteen minutes with all other forms of chew toys. Keeping them in flavored rawhide gets expensive. These things are a great deal. Big bones, flavors that make my dogs happy, and way less expensive than anything I could get at the local pet store.",515
2,"It is big and fits from the back to front of my trunk with lots of room, but it's not as sturdy as i would have liked.",118
2,"My Grandmother bought this for me when I was 2 years old. I've loved since then. I havent watched it in a while so I decided to watch it one day when nothing was interesting on T.V. This movie bought back so many memories of when me, my cousins (who I havent spoken to since i was 8) and friends were little. I knew every song and every line. Get this movie. It's a classic and a good movie for adults as well as kids. You wont regret buying this.",447
2,"This clever little thing is SO handy for walks, restaurants and car trips. I don't know why they're so hard to find; I bought mine from a random endcap display at Kroger, and have never seen them elsewhere. A great gift, too. Works exactly as advertised, and when it gets crusty, just toss it in the wash or dishwasher.",319
2,"A great bargain price for a great TV. Easy hook up, easy navigation through menu options. Great resolution.",107
2,"With all the classic symphonic, melodic, and ballet elements of a Tchaikovsky composition, this Manfred is haunting, brilliant and seamless, as good a Tchaikovsky symphonic performance as you could want, and the most enjoyable I have yet heard. You don't have to work at this performance . . . the musical poem just rolls along.",328
2,"Pixar have done it again, Toy Story 3 is the best of the trilogy by a mile, Very highly recommended. I hope they make another film so that my son can enjoy it. He loves all 3 of these films, in fact the whole family did.",220
2,"This is an excellent album for anyone who is getting sick of the more traditional Christmas music. Blackmore's Night does some very original-sounding renditions of Christmas songs with great instrumentation. The ocharina on ""I Saw Three Ships"" is particularly enchanting. This album includes ""Wish You Were Here,"" which was a pleasant surprise. I lent this album to a friend and didn't get it back, which I would take as a positive endorsement...",446
2,"I saw this film when I was 10 years old and I don't remember getting much sleep afterwards. If you want a decent scare I'd recommend this film for it far outways the films that follow. This is a genuine thrill ride with state of the art effects and a creepy as hell plot. A murderer comes back as a doll and starts killing everyone. Brilliance. Too bad it could never be repeated, at least not effectivly.",405
2,"As an elementary teacher, I am always searching for books that will help me teach my 16-month-old daughter various subjects. Show Me! is one of the best books I found to teach the names of body parts. This book focuses on parts often neglected by other books, such as the knees and the chin. The book makes it easy to act out the words and interact with the child. For example, ""I'm gonna tickle that tummy!""",408
2,This is another very good album by Paradise Lost. I am used to hearing very good albums by them. i don't know but i think that the vocals sounds like James Hetfield. The guitars are very rhythmic as always and with the appropriate pauses to give a feeling of porosity. Its a little bit melancholic but very good. The production is very good and i adore the sound of the drums (one of the best sounds i have ever heard) Buy this album,433
2,"This is a GREAT book. Beautifully written, a story about love and ultimately loss. There are several sub plots going on at the same time in this book but the author blends them so well, you never feel lost. VERY original and insightful look at how people from two totally different cultures seem so different but really are not. Things are not always as they seem . By far the best of all of Oprah's picks in my opinion. LOVED IT!!",431
2,I was one of the lucky 70.000 people who had the chance to watch Pearl Jam live that night. It was a grat show because both the crowd and the band itself was very enthusiasted. (I have seen them before in Istanbul). I think some of the solos and Eddie's vocals are a good proof of how the band enjoyed the show as well. This album is a must for every PJ fan because of the raw energy it contains.,396
2,This is a really cute and soft comfy stuffed pet for comforting or snuggling with your pet. Our pet loves it especially when he is cold or not feeling good.,156
2,every song is meaniful. there is just so much in the words is like riding on an emotional roller coaster but to the point and so real. SOUVENIRS!!,146
2,"Airport Terminal Pack is a good value if you like movies from the 70's. I personally purchase more classic and older movies than I do current titles. The original Airport was kind of a yarn for me, but I did enjoy the remaining three: Airport '75, '77, and '79.",261
2,"The movies on this DVD is as good as one can expect (I like western movies; therefore, I cannot give a bad review unless it is really bad). The actors in these movies were in my opinion is amongst the best of the eraReccomends to others who wish to purchase",257
2,"Great gift, to a very appreciative grandfather, great condition, perfect size and style, great sound quality and a very great find.",131
2,"Wasn't sure how this would work out, took over 600 pictures with this lens on my Canon SLR EOS Rebel. Was shooting a Hockey Tourney over the very weekend I got it, Every picture was great, The delivery was the as usual 2 day service from NYC NY. to PEI Canada. Will be using this company for all my future online shopping needs.",328
2,Works perfectly and the price was superior to anywhere else! It came exactly when it said it would too - good experience.,121
2,"Visually this DVD is pleasing, even refreshing because of the seaside scenes and the gentle charm of Scott Cole. I have a number of physical challenges and have found the Tai Chi steps presented here easy to follow and practice. The steps can be creatively used as shown or isolated and done separately at different times of the day. I would recommend this DVD, and have, for those with fibromyalgia, or chronic pain and fatigue issues.",436
2,"A chicken family awaits the arrival of a new family member. Truly unique illustration-- rooster, hen, and chicks are created with cloth. There is a wonderful feeling of texture and depth, and the chicken characters are absolutely adorable.One odd note is that the egg is alone, not warmed by it's mother. But putting that aside, the book shows some real bird behavior (the family roosts, the chick ""pips"" through the shell). Children will anticipate the arrival of the new baby and be delighted by the simple cute story.",520
2,Flight Sim 2000 is a great game if you have a good computer. I currently have a 500mhz computer with the new 3d card and it runs great. The graphics are really good and the game is a lot of fun to play. i suggest buying this if you have a powerful computer.,257
2,"My son got this for his first Christmas and he was only 6 months old. He loves this table! He's almost 16 months old now and he still plays with it almost everyday. Even his sister, who is almost 6 years old, loves to play with the table with her little brother. Great buy and if you are thinking about getting this table, it's worth your money!",345
2,"A distressing look into how far will some people go to get attention. Through detailed case studies and analysis, the authors take readers into the lives and minds of people whose obsessive craving for attention compels them to fake illness, sometimes to the point of death.",274
2,"This CD has all great songs! They all rock, and LTJ is the best! Buy this right now!",84
2,"dont think it too much... just get one of these! Mix you favorite powder drink in seconds... mix your juices from the fridge after storage... when pulp precipitates to the bottom... Very easy to clean! You can put apart all elements (4); My mother has 2 of them since 95 and they are still as new but!, you should not leave a coloured drink for too long cause it will leave a light tint on the mixer pole cause it is a rubber piece... Its just perfect...",454
2,If you like the southern rock sound with the blues then this album is great. I owned it on CD and now again in my digital library.,130
2,"I became aware of this book through Young's appearance in the ""Nico Icon"" documentary. The book is well-written, dry and dark but not without compassion.",153
2,"Hunter Wayward is way cool!!! Visited the gaming site and was blown away. I really like the character line-up, it is almost as the characters actually really do exist...heheh My favorite character so far is Kassandra Cheyoung. She looks like a tough chick who can kick some ***!!!!",281
2,"Excellent product, excellent price very satisfied with the quality of the product. i plan to buy again any time soon.",117
2,Bruce Lee is awesome! A good movie. Quality is as good as the original film. A must-have for Bruce Lee fans!!,109
2,"This is a great product for those days when you feel a bit anxious or on-edge. I tend to use two tablets during PMS, but it's good for a more balanced, calmer mood and feel. Very natural and non-habit forming.",209
2,"I never bothered with the HBO series, but the dvd is all you need to watch the whole thing and make more sense than the dribs and drabs of weekly tv. Perfect casting and great acting all around, especially Piven as the agent Ari Gold. Nice soundtrack, though the Rolling Stones circa 68 are a bit over-used at times. Looks like a Scorcese drama, but it's actually Mark Walhberg's work. Very much worth watching.",411
2,"This is Corey's first cd and not a bad attempt on the part of the popular 80's actor. There are four tracks on the cd, three of which are different re-mixes of You Give Me Everything. The fourth is a track called Do You Like it Like That. It is a decent track with part spoken/rap lyrics with Corey singing the chorus. It is true 80's dance music.For the ultimate Corey Haim fans, this is a must have for your collection. Songs are upbeat and fun to listen to and the picture of a shirtless Corey on the front cover really shows off his tatoo on his left arm.",559
2,"no complaints here. pellets are well made. good shot accuracy, good kill factor for varmints. Shot 30 of them and all hit within a 50 cent piece.",145
2,"If you order the check valve, you need this gasket. The old one won't be reusable. I was pleased with every part of this order. This was not a cheap immitation.",160
2,"Definitely a definitive must for any hip hop/rap fan. Brotha Lynch Hung is my favorite artist of all-time, and his along with Season of the Siccness are his two best albums. I can not stress enough how important this cd is in my collection. I will only take time out of my day to write recommendations for 3 albums, and this is one of them. A unique beat choice and classic appearances by Lynch's crew. MUST HAVE!",413
2,"As always L.K.H delivers, but this book had more drama than I expected. I'm not a drama person, but i really enjoied the book. L.K.H. always delivers.",150
2,As a huge Lightfoot fan I wanted to hear how others covered his songs. I found the selection of some of the songs to be odd as they aren't his best known. The others are the hits you would expect on this album. I found most of the interpertations interesting and worth listening to. In the end it reminded me how great Gordon is both as a song writer and a singer.,364
2,"I actually loved this massager, until is stopped working a little over a a week ago. Do you know if I can send this product back? I would love to have one that works. I ordered it on 3/4/08 and it worked for about 3 weeks and then one day I went to turn it on and it just didn't work.*** Update... I emailed the company I bought this from (Chamba). They immediately sent me another one, within 2 days (UPS). I am so happy with this massage. It's built very sturdy! It really helps my fibromyalgia muscles!!",506
2,"My son absolutely loves this and our youngest daughter is intrigued. I guess I have the older version. but this is great game for kindergarden and below. I guess the newer model its not as loud. that is the only knock i have on it, if someone in the room wants to watch the boob tube and not read subtitles or wear headphones.Its fun and my boy doesn't get upset when I beat him, he understands luck is involved. We repick our color right before we start each game, so that don't subconsciously cheat setting up the next game.",526
2,Met all my expectations. Easy to read in all lighting conditions and I can even read the time with my glasses off. Very light and comfortable with the rubber watch band and it dries instantly after coming out of the water. I use the bezel to time my pool workouts. I wear it all the time now.,292
2,"I thought this was going to be terrible and I was happily suprised it wasn't. It was actually hilarous in parts (again, not something I expected). Especially at the sale price it won't hurt to watch this one.",208
2,"I've been using the Omron for a month now and like is very much. It's reasonably pricedOmron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer, user friendly and the directions for the initial set up are easy to follow. My only disappointment has been in trying to calibrate my stride distance with a known number of miles that I walk each day. Whether I set my stride at 2' or 2'6"", I cannot get the pedometer to register the correct number of miles that I walk. Other than that, I'm happy with it.",482
2,This book was recommended by our Trigger Point instructor. It has been the greatest find ever and has saved me over hundreds of dollars in unnecessary medical care.It thoroughly explains how to get the results you're needing in order to feel relief from pain.I reccomend this book to eveyone! This book has given me the confidence I need in order to heal my own body and to rid myself of illnesses without medication.,417

Unfortunatley, I reached my destination before the book was finished. I plan to buy the additional audio books ofr future road-trips. . . .a good resaon to drive to California and back!!",321
2,"But rather I am here to praise the blue swizzle sticks of Accoutrements. For they are blue like no other and they swizzle up a storm. Strong enough for a Blue Hawaiian, yet delicate enough for the aqua-toned Misty Rum Forest, and daring enough to dive, un-color coordinated, headlong into a Mai Tai. One evening, with nothing better to do, I used one to mix and decorate my mojito. Of such experiences one becomes accustomed when you own accoutrements of tiki stirring.",469
2,"Ordered what I received,,,just as they should Be....No Surprises, No Quirks or mistakes, just great service and right on Time!!!",128
2,"Steven Chbosky's first book, THe Perks Of Being A Wallflower isprobably the best book I've ever read in my life. Before I read thisbook I didn't understand things about life as a teenager as well as I do now. The book is a collection of letters sent by a boy named Charlie to someone he's only heard about. Becouse the book is in a letter format, it makes it very easy to read and is more interesting. I loved this book and so have my friends since it depicts what teen life is really about",490
2,"If bad language does not make you wince, and you can deal with crude humor, WATCH THIS. Louis is clever and hilarious. I can't get enough of him, and ""Chewed Up"" is some of the funniest stuff I've seen a good while.",215

2,smackdown jbi is the best wrestling game. it has matches like hell in a cell table 3 stages of hell ultimate submission and etc. smackdown jbi has over 60 wrestlers when raw only has 30 something. the only thing that raw has is good graphics. in smackdown jbi u can create a taunt and u can create stables. limp bizkit comes out in a car. even though the story mode is short and u cant defend ur title in exibition smackdown jbi is still the best wrestling game.,462
2,"As hoped, Martin Clunes did not let me down as a comedic and serious actor. He's brilliant in making one fall in love with each character he plays.His character's outlook on life represents all in the working field. He's our voice!The entire cast of the show are all superb in their roles and without them their would be no Reggie Perrin. I'm can't wait for Set 2!",364
2,"I read this book recently and was quite compelled by it. Andrea Dworkin's analysis of the war on women is both powerful and shockingly brutal. While i do not agree with all her views on different subject matter, i do echo her thoughts on acts of rape and the people who commit those acts. this book voices her opinions on the different ways that women are raped every day. I understand the horror that people go through and i truly agree with andrea when she says that women should do whatever possible to fight back. Truly empowering and thought provoking.",557
2,A simple story that both adults and children can enjoy. It turns your mind and heart to the real meaning of Christmas whether you are religious or not. There's a lot in this little book for everyone.,199
2,"This book helped me understand music theory, thereby improving my music playing and appreciation. The factor that I enjoyed the most about this book is how it can appeal to beginners as well as advanced musicians. He explains everything very clearly. I enjoyed reading this book.",279
2,A magnificent exploration of the underbelly of Japanese culture. One of our biggest selling books filled with rude pictures and miniturisation.,143
2,Came in the mail quickly and does what it is supposed to do. No problems with it. Shares the music for two!,107
2,This flash drive works as advertised. I copied over 2.5 GB of pictures from my laptop to this flash drive with no problems. The quality and feel of this product is excellent. I also love that you can slide the usb connector into the protective housing instead of using a cap. This 4GB flash memory is perfect for what I need. I highly recommend it.,348
2,This is a great CD. Buy it! You'll love the melodies and listen to every track over and over (as I did).,104
2,My granddaughter watches this movie constantly. Cute story line. Funny and cute movie. A must see if you have small kids.,121
2,"The Barbie Island Princess Doll was a hit with my 3 year old this Christmas. She kept asking for a ""doll who sings"". The doll sings by pressing button on her necklace. She sings 3 (?) different songs from the movie. The feather-wings are kinda aggravating, they are made to be detachable. The only solution would have been to make them permanent. Happy with purchase!",367
2,"This is an excellent life jacket for dogs, but my Westie should have fit easily in the medium, but it was too big, the small was way too small. The flotation part itself is workable, but I had to make new straps as they would not go small enough on the medium, and the small's flotation part was too small for proper protection and fit!",336
2,I have bought several pocket ashtrays for different reasons (1 looks like a dice). This has to be the best one. You can fit about 3 butts in it (4 if you squish it in) and the others seem to be smaller. Just put the butt in and close it! Put it back in your pocket or purse and empty it next time you can. I would recommend this one over the rest. Zippo makes good products!,374
2,I used this on both my sons. Jordan loved being wrapped up in . Gabon didn't like being so confined. I liked it and it made them so much fun to cuddle with!,156
2,Wife and daughter like this curler. Highly recommended because good quality for reasonable price. Fit and finish is great and heats pretty fast,143

2,"Awww. Lenny, baby, I just love you. I miss his locs. Anyway. The album really is a greatest hits.

2,"this is the neatest gadget since sliced bread!! I love it. It has cut my prep time to almost nothing. I have made salsa and egg salad with it to near perfection. It chops tomatos and cukes like a dream. How did I ever live without one? I just ordered one for my daughter in law, her mother and will gift a friend with one. Please keep these available. They are great. Who ever came up with this should win the ""Nobel Prize"" for making cooking easier.Merle",455
2,"This is a truly moving movie. The little boy playing the main character Chava is extraordinary. There is unfortunately not much background information explaining the reasons for the civil war. Another shortcoming of the movie, according to me, is that it tends to give an idyllic account of the guerilla, who appear as the ""good guys"", while the army are the bad ones. I doubt this was entirely the case, although I am not a specialist in this case.For a probably more realistic account of the ways of guerillas in Latin America, check ""Palomas de papel"".",555
2,I have used this facial steamer about 5x now and I have to say it works well at opening your pores but the negative about it is that it gets very hot and you have to stay so far away from it or it will burn. Otherwise it works like it says it will and I am happy with my purchase.,280

2,"This stuff is fabulous! Much better than what I thought I was getting (the Liz Claiborne Realities) when I happened to find the small pink package at TJ Maxx for $12 last summer, just shopping for last-minute things to bring on vacation. Customs confiscated it on the way back from Grand Cayman, so I promised myself I would get the big bottle when I found it again. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price - way better than drugstore prices.",461

2,"When I first read Number The Stars I suspected it would be about a girl who was living in Denmark during the Nazi occupation. I never would guess that Annemarie's friend would be Jewish. This is such a great book and I recommend that you borrow or buy it. This book's message is you must be brave no matter how scared that you are. It also informs you on how horrible things were during World War 2. This was my favorite line in my interpretation: Annemarie took the necklace in her hand and sigh ""until then"", she said to herself,"" I will wear it myself.""The End",563

2,"I have read that several people had problems dealing with this company's customer service, but my experience was great. They were very helpful, friendly, and expediant.The greatest thing about this product is that, unlike the toilet, I don't have to scrub around it every time my son uses it. There is no splashing, forgetting to put up the seat (or lid), or falling in it. You still have to keep it clean, but it saves parents a lot of time and energy.Totally worked for my son...and it has only been 3 weeks!",510
2,"I like this shampoo! High five. My hair is wavy and fine but there's A LOT of it. I've only been using the shampoo for about a week, but my hair seems less frizzled and tangled.

2,"I managed to catch this on Turner Movies one night and loved it. The interplay between Ted Healy & the Stooges is good. The storyline is at times, very weak. But it shows the building of the Stooges. Least we not forget that there were FOUR Stooges in this film! Fred Sanborn was the ""silent"" Stooge and at times I wanted him to do more than whisper and wiggle his eyebrows.Do I recommend the film? YES for any Stooge fan! IT IS A MUST!Now MGM, get off yer cans and release ""Meet The Baron""!",491

2,"I was skpetical about shelling out almost $100 for a table saw blade but had heard about the quality of Forrest blades. I must say, I have not been disappointed. Not only has the blade held a sharp edge, but most cuts come out so smooth that they do not require sanding. I had been using Freud blades but no longer. I find the Forrest blade far superior and well worth the price.",379

2,"These candies are delicious. The shipment arrived within 2 days of the order date (thanks to prime) and were extremely fresh! They did not have the consistency I was expecting, but they're great nonetheless. I guess I was expecting them to be a little more ""tough"", but that can be easily achieved after opening the bag and letting them.. stale up a bit.. But either way I was very impressed with the freshness and taste of these gummi candies as well as the prompt delivery.",475

This album is filled with so much good music, a lot of it has been recorded by many other artists and topped the charts. When I first heard Don't if make you want to go home,I had a little moisture build up. If you are nostalgic and liked Joe South this is the CD for you. I guarantee you'll love it.",378
2,I recieved this recording as a Christmas gift in 1999 and I must say it was one of the best gifts I recieved. I had never heard of Mr. Belew until I recieved the disk and I am an instant fan. This is a very positive recording and the power can be felt. A must have recording.,275

I'll be giving it to my guy for the rest of his life if it keeps working so well!,404
2,"Well, them Supertones are growin' up nicely. Though not as totally addicting as their debut Adventures, but much more mature. Still just as fun to see live, this band spans a few gaps and shows their versatility in this release. A cut or two approach hip-hop rap and yet there's another cut that goes the other direction...all of the songs that fill the gap between Away From You and Grounded are worth every penny I spent on this CD.",434
2,"""Vogue"" has to be the best maxi-single ever released. Just the 12"" Version of the song is enough to justify that statement. The two other mixes on here are good, too.",166

I read this book about 3 years ago but George Sand has stayed with me, though she has been dead for centuries her fiery nature has been reincarnated in her biography. If you like strong women who are true feminists without bothering with the crusade or the label this is the book/woman for you.",482

I couldn't be happier with this product!",448
2,"Tom Waits has always has a knack for creating moody, melancholy masterpieces. This track is no exception. A dark and gruff country flavored ditty, ""Hold On"" is a logical progression from his previous work. Hope and Despair seem to dance a slow Texas two-step here, as Tom reminds us over a plodding, almost dirge-like western guitar sound to ""...take my hand, I'm standing right there, you gotta hold on..."" Beautiful imagery, great atmospheric music, plus the addition of two non-album tracks make this one worth buying for sure.",530
2,"Come on now..seriously. It's just a paddle ball toy. The ball is already on a string and it comes ready to play with out of the package. The string is already attached to the paddle in the package. Even if it does somehow come unattached, there is a hole in the paddle to stick it back through and tie it off.I honestly think the negative review was meant as a bad joke. Notice they rated the toy with 5 stars for durability. Strange if it cause so much trauma to the family.",475

2,"Terry Stamp and Jim Avery and company provide the perfect antidote to the complexities that became adult oriented rock. This was uncompromising honest stuff. Brilliant songs, well performed.

2,"You really can't beat it for the money. I use them while exercising cause they stay on very well, look good, and sound great (to me at least). The only issue I had was that the first 2-3 times I used them on the treadmill they would build up a static charge and shock me! I wasn't expecting that because this is my 2nd pair (first ones lasted 2 1/2 years). But I can run 45 minutes no problem now so it seems to have gone away, maybe they just need to be broken in a bit first?",477

2,"The only book by Ackoff that I would recommend more highly is Re-creating the Corporation. These two books summarize much of his thought and philosophy of business design.

Put on your thinking cap and delve into Ackoff's Best.",440

2,"A good introduction to a thoroughly arcane subject: The Theory of Relativity. But Aczel dwells far too long on Arthur Eddington and his journey to photograph an eclipse in an effort to prove or disprove Einstein's idea. The book could almost be retitled ""Al and Art Tiptoe Through the Cosmos."" The private respective lives of both Einstein and Eddington are not central to the topic and the search, which Einstein explains as, ""...wanting to know God's thoughts."" The book does present Einstein--justly or unjustly--as someone I wouldn't want to cross.",552
2,"This is GREAT live cd and the companion cd adds so much more to the old songs (particularly the becoming and the fragile). The new songs have a very nostalgic feeling to them... kinda sad (which is perfect). Just buy it, it's NIN and we know what reznor is capable of.",268

2,"I have really enjoyed Faith Food. It has strengthened my faith and is a great start to the day. I have bought over 20 copies for friends and family. Kenneth E.

2,"I wanted mirrors that weren't convex. I hate those, you can see cars behind you but you can't tell how far away they are. I also wanted real glass, the plastic ones scratch too easy. If the mounting system was just a little better I would have given these fine mirrors five stars. They do require a bit of tinkering and occasional re-tightening. No problem.Ed Waggoner",368
2,This book is a wonderful book that will make you cry with every passage you read.

2,"Unlike many all-digital compilations offered by one orchestra and conductor, this collection of Mendelssohn favorites is outstanding in performance and interpretation throughout.

Full of soaring, bittersweet mellodies matched with haunting Coldplayish guitar tones, ""Out Of Nothing"" shows great potential for Embraces next album and proves once again that British bands are better!",292
2,Wizards Holiday was an enjoyable read. However it Cannot be read in isolation. With this Book Duane is really starting to get more of an Epic feel to the Young Wizards Series.Note that there are some longer reaching story arcs which get started in this book but do not get developed substantially. The Reason is that they will be continued in the eight and I belive in the ninth book (which isn't out yet).,406
2,"This book is priceless, abounding in love for the Lord Jesus Christ. Adrian Rogers' love for our Savior and his devotion to Him is a beauty that must be read.

It will lift your heart in praise to Almighty God and what He has done and is doing for us. For Christ is King of kings, and Lord of lords, and greatly to be praised.",549

2,"Definitely a page-turner, a captivating love story. The author guides you through the intensely interesting history of the Mughal empire and leaves you wanting to know more. Unfortunately, she leaves you hanging, just as newly-titled Nur Jehan comes to throne. I would have liked to know more about her life as Empress, and how she carried out her duties. I also recommend reading a little about the Mughal Empire itself to give some perspective (that is if you are interested in teh actual history of it all). I'll definitely check out her sequel.",548
2,"This CD is great. Anyone who is a fan of Hootie and the Blowfish will appreciate this disk. Lyrically speaking, this CD is definitely the strongest CD to come from Hootie and the Blowfish.

2,"This book is a definite ""should read"" on the list of anyone considering how to reach out to build a deeper and more intimate community. It addresses how we validate or invalidate ways for people to belong, even without knowing it. While the book does not provide ""the answer"", which I appreciate, it does give a whole new prospective with which we can figure out how to address people belonging to our relationships.",416
2,The book was very well written and had many informative and inspirational points to it. A 93 year old woman and I get together and reading Christian books and read the Bible. This book enhanced our time together and blessed our spirits.,236

The whole band is a beauty!,312
2,"Ok, I live in Minnesota where it has been -10 for about the last 3 weeks. I spend lots of time out on the ice, ice fishing and these have kept my feet nice and toasty warm. They are a bit on the heavier side, but it's nothing I can't deal with. They stick to the ice great, like I'm walking on cement, and they are the warmest boot I have ever worn. Can't wait to use these for some hunting next fall! Would definitely buy again and I highly recommend them.",457

2,Cover fits well and does its job. The only complaint is that there are two draw strings to make it tighter. You have tho pull and try and tie some kind of knot. I wish there was a draw string lock like on some sandals. My knotts don't always hold.,247

Each photograph (taken by Bill Henson) is a moving photograph of a father and his son(s), accompanied by a essay written by the father, son, or both.

2,"I take salsa lessons, do a lot of workout videos and am in pretty good shape. While this video isn't much of a cardio or dance challenge for me, it is fun and a good way to break up the monotony of aerobic workouts. The instructor has great energy and the music is enjoyable. The steps were not hard to learn, but I can see what the other reviewers meant--that she is not good at cuing throughout the combinations, but you can still pick up the steps without too much trouble. Overall, I thought it was a fun way to spice up working out.",537
2,"I ordered two kinds of plain black crocs, and these were the better-fitting of the two.

2,"This movie is pretty amusing when you want something light to watch. Coming from a Minnesotan, I thought all of their accents were really forced but, hey, they tried. Anyway, its good fun but not to be taken seriously. We're not really trailer trash here. Lona Williams is from my town (rosemount) so it was fun to see familiar scenery in this movie.",350

2,"Rat-a-tat-Cat is the best card game to play with kids, ever! It is both fun and challenging. With young children (5-10) it's best to play with 4 cards, 2 up and two down, so they can remember the values.

It's very sturdy and the tips are nicely pointed for turning bacon or anything else you need a fork for when cooking. I'm very happy with this product.,303
2,"This book was a requirement for my pre-engineering class at Ohio State. Since I am an adult learner with an extensive learning background, I can really appreciate the way the book is laid out. Rather than relying heavily on theory, the book uses real-world engineering examples that spans disciplines for a well-rounded set of example problems. I would only ding the book a half-star because of typographical errors in some of the problems.",440

2,"This Copper Pepper Mill is Awesome!If you are a Pepper Lover, You'll love this PepperMill!",90
2,You won't be able to put this book down! I read this before the Davinci code and actually liked A&D better. The author has a brilliant and imaginative mind.

2,The title pretty much says it all. With most dance videos selling for upwards of a hundred dollars this Merce Cunningham dvd is a steal.,136
2,"What a series! Started reading based on my son's recommendation. Interesting, once I got going, and it continues to take me places I never could have imagined. Never boring, some loose ends and leaps of logic, but it keeps you glued so that you continue reading the books. This book maintains a high level of imagination, surprises and plot twists. I love that the women characters act, think and react like real people. These women are inteligent, strong, courageous, and far from timid. So far I am impressed and genuinely enjoying reading this series of books.",563
2,This CD is listening enjoyment. REM's new mix of softer tunes togeter are a calmer version of their previous sound. Michael Stipes signature voice makes UP a pleasure to hear.,175
2,"While one of my goldens has no time for this toy (she is a princess who doesn't like to work for her food), my male LOVES his tug-a-jug! He will work at it for an hour until all the kibble is dispensed. You can actually see the wheels turning as he figures it out, and he is pooped when he's done. Great for body and brain. Only caveat: use this toy on carpet-- it is really noisy on a bare floor!",397

2,"Perhaps the best thing about the three essays published in this exhibition catalogue is their readability. You don't need to be a student of the History of art to appreciate and understand them. However, they are by no means dumbed-down either. The images chosen for the exhibition are truely lovely. There are genre scenes, sea scapes, still lives (both floral and breakfast images), church interiors, and potraits. It is a wonderful little gem.",446

2,"Born and raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses I am well aware of their teachings. Even as I write this I fear I am doing somethng ""wrong"". Anyone once a Jehovah's Witness will understand what I mean. This book allowed me to stop feeling guilty and to stop feeling that I am alone in my feelings. You don't have to give up belief in God to stop believing in the ""organization"". The guilt can stop now!",400
2,"This is a small, easily read book of quotes. There were several inspiring quotes and several famous quotes. Sometimes it seemed as though there were repeats of quotes or they were stuck on a theme. I wish the book was longer and referenced more outstanding speakers/thinkers. OVERALL... I am very satisified. I purchased this book as a resource for students it will fit well in the classroom.",392
2,"this is a fun light-hearted movie. I tend to care for easy going, not too complicated movies. The sense of humor is classic, not modern. This movie is clean, in humor and in inuendos. If you lean toward the classics, i do believe this one would please.",252
2,"Colin Firth's acting is perfection. Each actor is terrificand acts their part very well. I thought Mr. Collins wasparticularly droll. I'll bet he is just as amusing outsideof the movies and would make a fun and interesting personto invite to a party. If you like Jane Austen, this is thebest.",292

The flourescents take about 1 minute to fully brighten. However, I like the light from the flourescents better and they use about 20% of the electricity. These have a slightly yellowish light compared to the flourescents.",364
2,"From a true pioneer outdoorsman...I love Calvin's tales interspersed in his readings with some opinions tossed about about politics, economics, and the state of his future and now, our past...Just very well written from an original. His stories that he chats about in between are short and enjoyable. I love his work.His works will be remembered for a long time...if you like some dry humor tossed into full character...this is the ticket.",439
2,"This is a good CD, for the most part. Thin Lizzy was not a band with many media hits, but that does not mean that they were not a great band, because they were. ""The boys are back in town"" ""Jailbreak"" ""Dancin' in the moonlight (It's caught me in its spotlight"" ""Still in love with you"" ""Whiskey in the jar"" and ""She knows"" are the six songs that really stand out.",363
2,"I tried this before spending $400 for tooth whitening at a location near me (using Rembrandt products). I was very pleased with the results. Hardly a day goes by that someone doesn't ask me how I got such perfect, white teeth. I found both trays in my mouth at the same time a bit uncomfortable, and it made me gag at first, but I soon got used to it. It's certainly a good value for the money.",394
2,"I have read alot of these types of books, and as far as I am concerned, I thought it was far superior to most of the otherbooks that I have read about strippers and or exotic dancers. Her story was thrilling and very well written....I suggest reading it and form an opinion for yourself...",289

2,"I found this biography of John Quincy Adams's Life to be very in-depth and interesting. It was written well and helped me with a leadership essay I had to do on him. The childhood of Adams set the scene for a greater understanding shaping his persona and actions later in life. I had little knowledge of Adams' before reading the book and once I finished, I felt I knew him and felt sorry for the sacrifices he had to give up due to his family name, plus the expectations his parents layed upon him.",499

While I liked having an adult share it with me, this was a book I most enjoyed looking at on my own. I cherished the set but over the years I lost all but one of the tiny books. I was delighted to find this small copy. A wonderful book for young imaginative children.",454
2,"This router is well suited for the small job or occasional encounter with a heavier workload. The case although stylish, next to the other tools in the truck, lacks for good storage space and often allows your bits to bounce around inside. I have had troubles with the fine tune control knob. It does not stay put and allows the plate to drift when making frequent material changes. Still, I'm very happy with it, it has made me money and the work has turned out great.",469

2,"Some people have reviewed her as opera. This cd is certainly not opera: She does hit some notes that are not easy to reach for some singers. This cd is sort of like a new age cd. For example, the music background has a feeling of the famous and well known new age group called Adiemus. Shapplin also sings some songs in latin as well. Do you like Sarah Brightman, Charlotte Church, Enya, Celine Dion, and/or Adiemus? Then this cd is for you. Please also note that Emma Shapplin sings better then all those singers I just mentioned.",531

2,This is an outstanding product for GPS. This far exceeded expectations. The Garmin mount fits both my older garmin gps from about 5 years ago and a brand new one I bought just 6 months ago. It holds the gps on the dash and doesn't move. One of our suv's has a very slanted dash and works perfectly. This is really one of the best things we bought in years for a car products. Highly recommend this if you don't want to use the window suction cup mount.,452

Well, some have their doubt and problems here. Just be old-computer aware to support your desires (if you have problems). Meaning, there are going to be plenty of new things in every ""Windows"" release, but since '98 you can choose whether to use them or not.

But it was a fantastic collar while it lasted.",425

2,"This twelve track disc is a tad better than their 'Orbvs Terrarvm' CD(see my review).For this record,the band has been stripped down to just two members,former Killing Joke roadie Alex Peterson and Andy Hughes.My prefered cuts are the first two,""Delta MK2"" and ""Ubiquity"" in which I notice in the credits for these two listed is Steve Hillage(Gong,Khan,Arzachel).Hillage must've have co-written the two songs with Peterson and Hughes.I also sort of liked ""Passing Of Time"" and the extremely far-out sounding ""72"".A good title,if you enjoy electronic music",555

MC2 & JDOG are both really sick, I like their style, the beats are pretty sick on most of the tracks. I really like this CD, and you can get it for like $6 brand new now on Amazon or Ebay, so pick it up!Oh yea, and on the last track there is a hidden song that is real sick, so don't miss it!H.BIZZLE!",466

2,"HiI have been using the unit for about a month now. The only problem I am having is that it feeds paper crooked. If you put the paper in straight, when the first sheet feeds it tilts all of the remaining sheets in the hopper to the side. After the first sheet, they all feed through at an angle. Is there a fix foir this? I have not yet contacted Canon.Other than that, the unit works very well and I am quite pleased.Sean",422
2,I own this TV and it has all the features of a Sony latest models with the exception of WOW sound and PIP. With the price difference of this TV with the latest model you can buy a good music system. The quality of the picture is good. I hope this helps.,253

2,If your just starting in the field ofRF design it is better to start off witha more basic RF text book. I found this moreindepth book an excellent addition to my librarywith lots of real world circuit examplesand up to date references. Itcontains a glossary explaining everysymbol. Basically everybody in my designgroup wants to borrow it from me.,347
2,"Let me preface my review by stating that I recently had shoulder surgery and ColPac has been a great source of pain relief!! I own several different sizes of the ColPacs. I have found this size to be perfect for all my needs. Because of the heaviness of the pack, you get a thorough icing of the area. The vinyl is soft yet extremely durable. I highly recommend any of the ColPac products.",389
2,"These toggle clamps and the other variations are just the ticket for jigs and custom clamping device's. Highly adjustable for almost any application, they have too many uses to list in a couple thousand words. I use them on sleds, fences, jigs for cutting miters on small pieces, hold downs for the chop saw and on the drill press, and on the bench to hold small pieces while I carve or sand profiles on them. Once you get a couple and use em, the idea's will flow.Highly recommend.",482
2,"I'm working on the Starter Stockinette sock at the moment and it took me a while to figure out the heel turn and the gusset, but once the light bulb went off in my brain, it's been a breeze!! I really like how the instructions are laid out with each pattern, so that you know what to do next!! I've never knitted socks before, and I can't really tell you why I want to now, but for some reason I was intrigued by the process, and now I can do it!!! I Definitely recommend this book to beginner-intermediate knitters.",516

2,"We love LOVE this baby wash. I have used it since my son was first born, and he will soon turn 3. It is expensive, but each bottle does last quite a long time, and its well worth it. The smell is wonderful, and doesn't last long--a good thing in my book, as I don't want him covered in scent, even a naural one. The foam is silky and rinses easily with no residue. When we use a different brand for travelling, I can always tell that his hair isn't as soft and clean as it is with his Earth Mama wash. I only wish I could afford to use it on myself too!",553
2,"It gave me totally great sound, no buzzing a low bass and not extremely high in tweet pitch.And every one giggling how its look when see me wearing it.",151

2,"This was the very first diet pill I tryed and was very happy with results. It really worked. The only problem i had like many others is the effects. Although I didn't have many negative effects, due to me eating right and following the, I noticed some times when I splurged just a little(popcorn) it had horrible results. Unlike many,I never pooped on my self but it did make me want to use the bathroom really bad or would hurt my tummy if i didn't.",450
2,"THE ZERO GAME is a fine political adventure based on an innocent enough betting game between congressional staffers which turns into murder. It's heavy on the yawn-inducing stuff of political bartering, & lively in the tight spots into which the two surviving heroes are herded by invisible shepherds who have a lot to lose, no scruples & fingers in very high up pies.Rebeccasreads recommends THE ZERO GAME as one bumpy, entertaining ride!",439

2,"Amazon:Your presentation of the offered product was succinct, to the point and informative. I am more than pleased with the visual product. All the dvd's were without blemish, the color definition excelent; but the packaging of the dvd's was problematic. The individual dvd containers seperated from the six-disc cover, thus making insertion into the cover jacket difficult.Ask me about Nikita, the 3rd season. That review will be more crictical.",446

2,"A good greatest hits collection especially if you are not a humungus fan of Janis but basically appreciate her style. I always liked her take on Me and Bobby McGee and the driving Move Over. Try Just A Little Bit Harder is kind of spunky and I certainly appreciate all the feeling put into Summertime. No matter what songs you prefer or not, Janis certainly left her mark on the 60's era. This is a good keepsake to remember her by.",432
2,"This works well and I'm quite happy the results. Even though it's not the recommended purpose, I purchased this for use in my Dorm room, since I was getting a really choppy signal after the signal had been sent through an extra 25ft cable. Even though (as warned) there is some noise produced, at least I can watch TV with out it constantly cutting out.",353
2,"Space Race was a classic album when it was released back in the '80's. Fans of The Fixx, early Simple Minds, and Classix Nouveaux should relate well with this cd. This is synth tinged guitar New Wave. Mi Sex was a New Wave/New Romantic band from New Zealand that had a few hits "" Space Race"" and ""Computer Games"". I had both of these albums on vinyl and am quite happy to see these re-released on compact disc. For more info go to www.allmusicguide.com",452
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed Paul Van Dyk's compilation here especially ""I'm Comin'(to take you away)...very sensual and borderline provacative, ""For An Angel""...great ""T- dance"" tune to get you pumped up on the dance floor...he'll keep you up and bumpin it with the title track ""45 RPM"" with the same high ENRGY tempo. ""Emergency"" will leave you startled as you anticipate the arrival of an ambulance siren. This culminates with a reprised version of ""For An Angel"" leaving you craving more. Keep it comin' PAUL!",505
2,I bought this for my otherhalf as a Christmas Present. He was stoked when he opened it and 5 minutes later I have Slipknot screaming out of my stereo on Christmas Morning. Not exactly a family tradition.lol He loves it and I have now banshed the CD and the excessive noise to his car and new car stereo. At least the peace has returned to my house. :) Enjoy!,358

This one is especially great though..To Each His Own..Ventura Highway..Till the Sun Comes up Again..Head and Heart..oh, so many wonderful songs are on this CD..buy and enjoy!",329

2,"I bought this case for my 13"" laptop. There is ample room inside the case and enough pocket room to store the mouse, cables, e-reader, small camera,i-pod etc.. The padding seems adequate but I wouldn't want to drop it from more than a height of about 4 or 5 feet. This is my first computer case so I'm not sure how much padding a more expensive case has. This is a sturdy, basic case that serves its purpose.",408
2,"I first heard it on France's version of VH-1. I was so mesmerized by ""Assassine."" My brother went to a music store across from our hotel in Paris and bought one for me and one for him. I haven't stopped listening to it! And I got it two years ago! It's way good!",262

2,"I loved everything about this ring..unique design, comfortable, nice weight. I received it on X-mas eve and wasn't expecting to receive it in time for the holiday..bonus. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the sizing, it runs a little large. My overall experience with this company was excellent.",318

2,"So this was my first fine watch purchase and Amazon made it nice and easy. I would suggest that you check out the watch in person and jewelry. You can't beat the price that Amazon will give you. What I like about this version of Aquaracer is the waffle face, the automatic movement and the band. The band has two tones of silver that works well with the black/grey face.I believe that this watch is appropriate in all settings. The dial is very bright at night, so no worries there. Great buy...even better price.",513
2,"Cray has written a great book that made you not only feel like Mia but made you think like her and try to scream clues to her. This book is the best thiller I have ever read and it deserves many awards and praise. I hope all his future books are this great, I can't wait to read them!",284
2,"I was a member of the 1st battlion/9th Marines at Khe Sahn during the seige. I found the book accurately describes it as I remember it(deja vu). It describes life in your little world(~20 ft of trench & bunkers)that we lived, fought in & died in the 77 day long seige. It was the worst place in the world & the most honored place due to all the blood we shed. Khe Sahn is a major part of my life, no matter how old I become.",424
2,"I like Saul's sense of humor and practical approach. Since reading this book, I treat my kids' fevers and colds with TONS of vitamin C and it WORKS. Not to mention, I use it as a reference for many of the other ailments. I appreciate his take on things.",253

2,"I was disappointed that this food processor did not come with the small grater, as my former Kitchen Aid processor did. I had to pay $25 plus S&H to purchase one on line. This food processor tends to leak liquids when pureeing. Other than that, I like the size and design just fine, this size better than the larger 13-cup one, which I tried and sent back.",356
2,"Was worried whether or not it would fit large bore trombone mouthpieces but it was perfect for my Schilke 51. Also fits Bach 1G just fine. This is meant for trombone/euphonium mouthpieces, not tuba. Simple pouch does its job.",225
2,I love these so much more than the little clippers for baby nails. I use them on my infant and my 5 year old. They work wonderfully.,132
2,"I ordered this based on the reviews and the price. For the amount I paid for it, this is a powerful little coffee grinder. It is easy to use and does the job.The only reasons for the one-star deduction are: 1. It gives off a slight odor when you hold the grinding button down for more than a couple of seconds. I don't notice this if I just pulse on and off. 2. The capacity - if you make coffee for multiple people in the morning, you would probably have to grind beans in batches. I need to grind about 6-8 spoonfuls of beans per day, which it handles just fine.",564
2,This was a wonderful addition to my Granddaughters collection. She can carry the soft plush animals around and we don't have to worry about her falling on them and hurting herself. My grandson also loved to play with this set... I was very impressed.,250

Peter has a little sister named Jenny and a mom and dad. Whenever Peter does something to his grandpa he gets back. And one time grandpa took Peter fishing. If you want to know more read it.,372

I can't wait for #6!",408

2,"If you zoom in on the picture, you'll notice that it's actually 16 gauge wire. I received it and can confirm that it's 16 gauge. Wire works fine, although the spool that's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing. It's not a big deal though, and my only disappointment was on my end when I realized 100' wasn't enough to hook up my 7 speakers.",366
2,I received my movie in a timely manner. It was in excellent condition. I enjoyed watching it. It is one of my favorite movies. I would recommend buying from Amazon all the time. I'm hooked!!,190

2,"That this is my 2nd one and both of them don't latch very well. The outer latch basically just lays there and doesn't actually latch close the tooth. Not a big deal, just be aware of this. The interior hidden pocket area closes securely. My 7 year old has loved his for years and coins the size of a gold dollar coin and smaller will fit in the compartment where the tooth goes. Anything larger can just sit on top of the inner compartment, but again, this is where the defective outer latch may become a slight issue...it truly glows in the dark - a fun bonus!",561

2,"This is a WONDERFUL product. It works tremendously well. Do not follow the advice on the box to use peanut butter as the bait. Use bread crumbs or cookie crumbs, and make sure to leave some around the entrance to the trap as well. The electric shock instantly kills the mice. While not as humane as no-kill traps, you don't have to peel a suffocated mouse of a glue trap, or scrap a mouse with a broken neck of a traditional mouse trap. Buy it. Use it. Be mouse free.",467

2,"This book feels a gap between high level tutorials that do not get into any kind of technical details and the actual specification documents that can be overwhelming at first sight.The first part of the book is an overview of video coding and provide a technical description of important tool used in video coding such as DCT transform, motion estimation, motion compensation etc.The second part of the book focus on the specifics of MPEG-4 and H.264.More focus on the H.264 part would have been welcome.",504
2,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. Yes it's incredibly hard to watch, but it's worth it. This is one movie in the world everyone should see. It is very eye opening, and thought provoking. Unlike many other animal rights movies, this one actually makes the strongest argument I have heard. I am now a vegetarian. BUY IT WATCH IT!",329
2,After having a Mr Coffee we decided to see if a high end machine made any difference. Why did we wait so long? We have had this machine for 6 weeks. This machine deserves all the high ratings it has gotten. I liked coffee before but now truly enjoy my coffee. The overall quality of the machine is very high. The only negative is the very small place to pour the water in. You will not be dissappointed.,403

2,"I do not know the books. But the movie is well made, It just lacks originality. You get the feeling you saw those things before. I suppose with so many movies around it is hard to be original. However, the movie does hold the viewer interest and has good entertainment value. I wish the fight scenes would have been toned-down to accommodate a wider range of audience.",368
2,"delicate meaning: yes, it's one of the cheapest pizza stones out there. But as with any pizza stone, subject a hot stone to even the smallest amount of moisture (IE: a bit of sauce or cheese from the edge of the pizza) and it will crack VERY easily. But other than that it is a nice sized stone at a great price. Just be careful with it.Oh, and yes, it did come with a cheap pizza wheel that I have never used.",410

This is a great CD, and I highly recommend it!",350

She loves it so much that it is the first toy she crawls to in the room. She can now stand for longer periods and is now trying to cruise around the table. In terms of durability, it must be up against the wall or it easily tips over or scoots across the floor. Overall, I am very happy we bought this toy.",481

2,"This is such a fun book to read. It is about Pokey, the bear from the zoo in San Francisco, who runs away and gets caught and brought back more than once. It is especially fun if you buy it along with the cassette or CD. They are sold at Adventist Book Centers new. I'm sure they are sold other places as well.",310
2,"This is a must buy cd. It includes Redman, Method Man, Xibit, and DMX. The rap and rock in this cd is awsome. The intro and outro are both cool too. So if you're a Limp Bizkit fan and don't have this cd, then I suggest you go out to Wal-Mart or K-Mart and buy this awsome cd. The unedited version cd is even cooler but I had to get the edited one. My five best rated songs are My Generation, Rollin'(Air Raid Vehicle), Hot Dog, Rollin'(Urban Assault Vehicle), and Take A Look Around.",483

My entire order included other brown rice types, each bagged individually in an airtight bag and then all of those bags inside another heavy duty plastic bag.

I read this book in 5 days I liked it so much, staying up far into the night with a flashlight reading it. Clarissa is wonderful but I love Anna Howe, her kind and charismatic best friend, Lovelace is also interesting, and Belford is great as a good guy in bad company.

2,"What I like about this book, is that it doesn't have anything like stars according to how ""difficult"" it is to solve each problem. What really matters is how beautiful it is, how it makes one surprised. If you agree with me, get this.",234
2,"If you like Heavy Metal and the Musicals of Webber or Steinman (or together) have to buy it. This is musican live of Meat Loaf on 2 CDs. The three new songs are fantastics. Andrew Lloyd Webber is the best composer of now. It is 5 stars CD, but I'm missing ""For Crying Out Loud"". I have got a message to Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman: you could make more songs together with symphonic orchestras and then you will be the best band of rock and opera. Thanks, I've been Endi from Hungary",481

2,"This is an exciting historical mystery. It has intriguing characters, an intricate story and is full of realistic detail of the period. The language is intelligent and the major issues are as relevant today as they were nearly 300 years ago. A wonderful book.",259
2,"I got reeled into this story, but then I like stories set in this era. Is there a second season?",96
2,"very good, very good, is made &#8203;&#8203;of a material and is excellent can be used for any occasion, I received it in good time",131
2,Pros: The packaging is phenomenal! Its black and has Batman Ears. The movie quality is excellent.Con: It had far too much violence for timid me. I have yet to watch Disc 2. But I look forward to seeing how the movie was made and the other extra features.,254
2,"I got Metroid Zero Mission the first day it was avaliable in stores and I didn't stop playing for 4 days. It was a fun game. It was based on the first Metroid game. Samaus went around getting ice beams, missles, and beating up Ridley, Kraid, and Metroids. And the graphics were execelent. The only problem was that it was too short. Kinda easy too. But like I said, it was fun.",377
2,"Finally, a really heartwarming Chanukah story. This really needs to be made into an animated feature. We need something uplifting and joyful at the holiday season to try to balance the onslaught of Christmas cartoons. Very positive, great for the kids!",252
2,The movie was enjoy able and cinimaticthe story line was good. Some of it was funny but weirdI would recomend this to johnny Depp fans and vampire fans,151
2,"I am only half way thru but I can't put this book down. It's about the struggle between England, Ireland and America. Right now it's dealing with the potatoe famine and the people of Ireland being evicted off the farms because they arn't producing. Fever has struck and they are dying by the thousands. Very moving and sad but their is also a few love interest going on. Well, back to my book.",393
2,liberty x is a band made up five talented singers who lost out to the pop act hearsay on the british version of popstars. Now their back with a #1 hit single. The song has a very pop/rnb sound to it. This song makes you want to get up and dance to it. I recomend this cd for pop fans all over.,293
2,"I thought this CD was one of Michael's best. It was different but then that is why I am still an Oldfield fan after almost 30 years. I particularly liked the way he used the tracks as a history of man/woman, finishing off with an enjoyable finale. It will never be my favorite Mike Oldfield CD (Ommadawn has that honour) but I will never grow tired of listening to it either.",375
2,"The peach mango blend has a great taste, and mixes easily. The only downside that I can find for this product is the protein:weight ratio in a single scoop, which is less than other competing brands.",199
2,"The Pyramids Of Mars is my favorite Doctor Who episode. This is my favorite Wells adaptation to date. A freakish, fantastical telling of the Martian invasion that destroyed humanity at the turn of the century. Praise for supplying me with adult wit and dialogue and keeping to Wells' words and intention.",304
2,"I bought a wide aspect ratio LCD monitor so that I could have more room to work when doing digital painting, and getting the 4:3 aspect ratio of the tablet to map to the screen makes the vertical tracking seem like it's dragging. I had to resize the tablet mapping area to something around 3x5 inches to make it feel more natural. The obvious drawback is that there is a much smaller workable area on the tablet surface.",420
2,"Aloha Scooby Doo is yet another spectacular spinoff of the original cartoon show. My 5 year old daughter absolutely loves Scoob and the gang, and this movie was mysterious and very easy to follow. Perfect for young children and interesting enough to keep adults watching until the unmasking of the true villains at the end. Love you Mystery Inc!!",346
2,"We recieved this book as a gift after a major tragedy. It made us smile then, and now that we have a grandaughter, it makes us smile again, because she thinks it is the greatest. She doesn't want to eat clouds for breakfast, but she is dying to give her shoes to the fish in the pond",283
2,"Sydney White, a British journalist, who is extremely clumsy and a hell of an idiot, tried all his life to enter the celebrity world because he thought it is great and will make him very happy. He gets hired by a big firm in NYC called Sharp, which he can't help but continue acting like a total idiot around its staff and the celebrities. He then meets Megan Fox and feels very attracted to her. At the same time he is always annoying his colleague, whom in the end falls in love with her.A chick flick movie, with some stupid funny jokes",538
2,"Easy set-up and fit my Infiniti G35 Coupe without issue, even with the spoiler. Incredibly stable, even on long trips at 65 mph. Only issue was a broken tack weld (it happens) but I received a new unit within 2 days. Well worth the money and beats having to take the front tire off and stuffing the bike inside the car/trunk. Make sure the straps are tight AND the area is clean where the foam contacts the body.",412
2,Brutal and intense is how I describe this movie. Definitely not a film for everyone. Thought provoking. Mother Nature does not discriminate. No discussion. One must accept the harsh reality that wilderness can offer. I could relate to this movie because of my own personal interests and experiences with the outdoors. Please do not allow children to watch.,356
2,"Hopkins and Gooding give what is quite possibly the most impressive performance, in my opinion, of the year. If you have anything against either actor, however, I don't reccommend the movie, as 90% of the film centers solely on those two actors. On the other hand, if you're an avid fan of the two (as I am), this is a definite must to add to the collection.",358
2,"I have used this book since the first addition and give it out to all new engineers coming into the pipeline industry, when they are envolved in costs for new piping projects.",175
2,ALL I CAN SAY IS EXCELLENT. THIS CD MAKES ME LOVE THE COUNTRY OF MY GRANDMOTHER EVEN MORE.,90
2,This band is cooler live than me crapping on your face. These cds just hold you over till they come to your slum.But they are still good.Buy it.,144
2,"I have owned the $99 model Dream Machine for several years and think it's pretty much the best alarm clock/night stand CD player available. I purchased this model for my son because it seemed to have all the same features and was $40 less. This model does not have push button automatic volume control or a head phone jack, not bad for $40.",340
2,"Trapt's second full length album, Someone in Control, pales in comparison to their 2002 debut, but that's not to say I hate this album. In fact, it is a listenable album.Rating: 3.5 stars/5 stars",195
2,"Some of the best and most memorable music! His music brings life to my heart and soul. I have listened to this CD several times now, and bought one as a gift for my son, since he also loves his music with the movies.Truly an amazing conductor!",243
2,I ordered this bible for a friend who had difficulty w/ the King James Version. After a few weeks I called to make sure it was okay and he was very excited to be able to actually follow the words. The cover was perfect for a man.,229
2,"A voice so pure, effortless and flawless. What a gift - this voice.Brightman turns every song into a seductive love song. She could gargle mouthwash and seduce me. Definitely a CD for cosmopolitan lovers.",204
2,They have a protective finish and look nice enough for going out to a nice restaurant or casual enough for other interests. They are also comfortable. Thumbs up.,161
2,"I received my tv from Eagle and they unpacked it set it up and turned it on with no problems. We had to wait for Direct tv to change service to HD and that is the only problem I had. They could not hook it up to my Carver Home Theater, and so I have to figure it out. The picture is great the sound, well I used to more sound, better sound. I also receiver it in record time.It came into Newark airport and delivered a few days later. Great Price at this point.........Do It !",476
2,"I purchase the Teen Trends outfits for my Mini Super Dollfie (Luts Delf Kid), and they fit great, minus the shoes. The boots, if you slit the back the rest of the way down, fit my girl for photographing purposes, but the backs of her feet don't fit completely. I love the fact that the boots have hidden velcro on the back to keep them from opening or falling off...really great quality! The skirt is a bit too poufy, but easily flattened. Great little leggings, adorable skirt, and beautiful corset style top in black velvet! Really sweet, and looks great on MSDs!",565
2,"I enjoyed this show but power rangers and vr troopers were better in my opinion, but i can't wait to own this show too.",119
2,"I am a big RANMA 1/2 fan... ...i think the second season is much better, more fun,more action, more episodes (4 more episodes!) and its drawn better!if you liked the first season than you'll love the second one and the 3rd one... (from the middle of the 4th season it starts to get a little...[bad] and there are more clisheas......",332
2,"I totally LOVE this product. They are time consuming to make up BUT well worth it.Once the centers are made up, they are easy to maintain. I would highly suggest laminating the pieces. I did and they have held up very well. My students loved doing them. I would recommend for any teachers. Many times I used these as a reward for getting work done in class early. Students were able to pick what they wanted to do after completing their assignments.",449
2,"I put myself on a wait list, didn't get notified but ended up finding the 1025g jar at the International Market on Park Ave. in Memphis TN. I'm not sure if it is worth waiting for or not but our friend is going to love us for finding it. I'm now curious but don't dare open the jar.",282
2,"I do not have the most discerning ear inthe world, but these speakers are great and appear to be of good quality materials. I installed them in the ceiling in several rooms throughout my house and in the eves of the roof out back, above my deck. I use them for listening to music or sports broadcasts, so I can move about the house and even outside without missing a call of the ballgame.I've had them installed for over a year now and I've not experienced any problems.",470

But here's the good news, unlike other wax products this one does not hurt.. i mean after you use the strip..no other product has to be applied to kill the pain..

2,Bought this for my sister and she loves it. It's just the right length of time and a perfect workout.,101
2,"I have read this book three or four times cover to cover. However, I go back to it frequently when I am a little down or looking for something to chuckle about. I am never disappointed. I am looking forward to the next book.I have also sent it as a gift to a couple of people who are now ardent perusers.",304
2,"Telesco reminds us in this book that advancement isn't about complexity or power - it's about responsibility. And there were LOTs of great ideas for advancing one's abilities in this book (in fact, it's the only book I recall that ever talked about making elementaries, effectively doing group dream work, and finding one's magickal ""voice""). Hightly recommended for taking the next step forward from 101 books",410
2,It's great to be able to go into my closet and not waste time searching for that elusive pair of shoes that I wear once a year. The price was very reasonable and the boxes are well made. I'm planning on ordering another twenty boxes for my daughter's shoes. Some of the boxes I used to store Lego? pieces in my son's room. ***** 5 stars,336
2,The watch was received in good time and is a great buy. The only small problem was the band was too tight so I replaced it with my band from my old watch (also a Casio) which fit my wrist better.,195
2,"This is the best easy to follow Yoga video I have ever used. I am doing this every day and I love it. Highly recommend. Clear, concise instruction. I find most videos difficult to follow without watching and then I miss the pose. No problem with this video.",257
2,"This book is meant to be heard. It almost like getting a three hour therapy session for 15 bucks. Dr. Gullo is right on the money almost 100% of the time with his observations and recommendations. I have listened to the book twice already and I plan to listen to it again whenever my diet falters. If you are ready to live life as thin person starting today, you want to buy this CD.",383
2,"This is an excellent docudrama that serves as one of the all time great case studies in Leadership. Rarely in the history of man is there a more impressive example of leadership during a crisis. Shackleton's twenty-two month journey is a testament to the importance of values, vision and mission. This video is a just presentation of Shackleton's unbelievable accomplishments.",376
2,"I found this book to be both educational and entertaining.As a beginning I found the diagrams hard to follow and sometimes lacking.As a novice in knots tying and having the responsibilty of teaching young adults, this book was great for the history and use of knots but lacking in the illustrations needed for me to learn how to tie the knots.",343
2,"Rodney says if you put this and Jewel of the South together, you have three quarters of a good album. But this is one of my favorites. The back stories on some of the songs make it special as well as the collaboration with Guy Clark and back up from artists Trisha Yearwood and Patty Loveless. If you are a fan it will not disappoint, if you are a music aficionado looking to track the artist's growth and change this a the best of the ""Sony Years"".",449
2,"I picked up Life of Pi expecting a very different story than the one I received. Through it, I experienced many true trials, starvation of a soul, a burning desire for life and a more intimate knowledge of the spiraling ways of the natural world. Every page was written eloquently, the imagery is rich and vivid. I was enraptured through the entire story.I highly recommend this book, give it a chance and prepare to be astonished.",431
2,I bought this product as we the whole family are spanish spoken and we find this type of products very helpfull to maintain and further develop our english language skill continue to growth while entretained.,208
2,"This is a decent 2 way radio.Pros:Works wellGood sound qualitySturdy (dropped mine several times and they still work great)They will last (had mine for probably over 5 years)Cons:On the bulky sideA bit expensiveShorter rangeBottom line:I was at Target today and saw Motorola's radio, don't remember what it is but it has a 4 mile range, is tiny, and was only $17.99. I would go with something more along those lines. The FR60 is a good radio, but you can get better for cheaper.",478
2,"I think this book is very smart. It made me think about dating in a whole new way, and at age 58 being back in the dating market for 8 years, that's really saying something! The ideas are really creative - I can't wait to try them out, espcially Step #9.",254
2,"This is unlike anything I have ever read. It remains as shocking, in many ways, today as it did when originally released. This is a unique literary effort that also happens to be strongly illustrated.",200
2,"The Hornblower series is absolutely the best of its kind. Dewey Lambdin is fun and Obrien os OK, but the late C S Forester has provided me with pleasure since I was a kid. I couldn't pick a favorite. Lord Hornblower certainly does not lower the standard.",254
2,I like Woodrow and his style and specificity on topics he chooses to write on. Each element is written short sweet and right on target. In looking at various prophecy authors his stands out as informative and seems to follow scripture very well.,245
2,"Great little devotional book. Nothing too in-depth, but nice short devos that a busy mom can easily add to her day. I like Lisa Whelchel and have been impressed with her other books as well.",190
2,"Murphy has done a better than average job of pulling together the technical considerations of loudspeaker design. He focuses on closed and vented designs sufficient to allow the first timer a fighting chance at successfully designing and building a speaker. The use of symbols is less than admirable, frequently mixing lower case and upper case symbols (see ""F(sc)"" on pp 48 v. ""f(sc)"" on pp 26). Proofreading would have made the book more enjoyable (""sign wave,"" pp 47). Editorial comments aside, if you want a relevant and timely book for the beginner this is it.",565
2,"the characters come off a little mean but the kids liked it. I rented it on amazons video service, the $4 was a bit steep for a 11 yo movie.",140
2,"Most people I've come encountered with who have seen this movie generally have the same impression, 'not bad'. It's one of those movies that is not Oscar contention but you still come out of it feeling like you enjoyed it. It has some fresh faces to the screen and a fresh story line that hasn't been over-used. It's a feel good movie with some substance but nothing too deep, where in the end you just want to go dance.",420
2,"Folk tales of a famous witch or voodoo queen in Louisiana. She was from Haiti, so there is conflict with the Christian environment.1956, 96pp, with a bibiliography in back and several page on how to read palms. Hard to find.",224
2,"I have had this product for a year and a half, and it makes me more confident when running alone. I also carry mace. Should anyone try to bother me, the alarm is loud enough to at least scare someone since it would draw attention. I use the light, too, when running in the dark. I like this product!",299
2,"These authors have woven together a masterpiece that brings forth the importance of the new science of complexity in an understandable and practical way. They take us beyond where Margaret Wheatley invited us to ventured years ago, and support the importance of relationships as the basic unit of change. While the book is intended for business readers, it has application to therapists and anyone who is interested in genuine relationships, mutual respect and creative emergence of new ideas.",493
2,"The author carried several investigations critical to thecurrent view of the archaeological process of Peru. Thisbook resumes the full chronology and cultural secuence withthe view of the 70's. Despite the large number of discoveriessince these years, the general structure of that processand the main statements and hypotesis remain, so this bookcan be valuable to anyone seriously interested in the peruvianpast.",414
2,"I bought this book for my daughter, a senior in High School. She used it to confirm that her skill set really is appropriate for the major, Business, she is interested in. It's a useful book and we recommend it.",211
2,"Whether you prefer the colorized or the original black & white, there is only one true Scrooge -- Alastair Sim. This is a true classic and is well worth owning.As to the actual dvd, I've only watched the colorized myself, but have seen no issues with the picture displayed.",273
2,i have read a huge amount of previews for this game and it does sound and look very good . it probaly wont be up to the standards of tony hawk 3 which is coming out later this year but it should be interesting to see . i am deffinetly going to buy this game as i am a big fan of skateboarding and i will write another review saying what i thought of it later on .,363
2,Excellent product. Better than I expected. So easy to install even a woman can install it. :) (I did.) Quick delivery. Completely satisfied.,140
2,I bought these springs for a homemade trailer. They offer a very inexpensive way to add more capacity. I've also used a larger variation on a pick-up truck with good results.,174
2,I really enjoyed and still enjoy this double cd. Having this compilation playing in the car this is the kind of music that relaxes you and that brings back memories from the 80'S. Thanks to the great talent of this artist!Pity that the song 'I want you' jumps when playing but I guess this is to remind you that perfect happiness is impossible to achieve!,355
2,"It's great, haven't had a problem, travel size and good fidelity, feels smooth and runs flawless on almost any surface.. cool!",126
2,"I have all of her CD's and this one is by far her best! She should be here in the US on Tour promoting her unique style of Brazilian music, she is electrifying, and very energetic on stage! Please buy this CD and you will see why Daniela has sold millions of copies worldwide, (except in the US).",296
2,Lack of a lossless HD audio track is such a big turn off. Never would I think to double check the audio formats on a Bluray. Shame on Summit Entertainment!,155
2,I enjoyed this movie. It was good to see a different twist on an old Christmas favorite.,88
2,"This book is an excellent synopsis of the Dragonball series and Dragonball Z up to Captain Ginyus defeat. Even though it is inJapanese, the pictures are of great detail and color and the paper is of high quality. It also gives an entire list of every episode of dragonball z up to that point. They all come with a picture of what happens during the episodes so you can compare to the highly edited english version and see how many fewer episodes it took to reach the same events. It is a must for any Dragonball/Z fan and I highly recommend it.",544
2,Bought this from an Amazon sponsored site. Good price and speedy delivery. Very satisfied.,90
2,"This book comes in real handy for clinicals. If you have the opportunity to perform a new skill in the clinical setting, this book will walk you through it, as well as show you how to write a nurse's note on the procedure.",222
2,"They are very compact speakers which will fit onto any computer table. The sub-woofer does not have a bass/treble control, but they can be perfectly confgured by any software.But great sounding speakers with great looks!!!Should buy if you are looking for something under [$$$]",277
2,"This is pretty neat but the instruction book could be a little better. I like how you can design the time screen with the numbers you want to look at (heart rate, distance, etc.).",179
2,"I just got this oil because I repair fans and such so I need something like this. I'm also blind and call me stupid but I can't figure out how to open the darned thing. It doesn't seem to be easy, wished I just would of bought some spray oil",241
2,"1) VHS Tape Video When Tempers Flare by Paraclete Press. Anger is an emotion that is often expressed in extremes. Some people avoid showing anger at all costs, while others explode in rage and even violence. Both approaches can have detrimental effects on physical and emotional health. When Tempers Flare explores why and how we experience anger and offers practical strategies for expressing anger in constructive, rather than destructive, ways.",447
2,"I usually steer clear of kid's books, but my sister had and I only read this book because it had Grand Admiral Thrawn in it. It wasn't bad, for a kid's book, pretty interesting in some parts. I felt Thrawn should have gotten a better role in the book. Other than that, it's pretty good.",286
2,I absolutely love this quilt. It is light weight and the backing is cotton which is also great. It lays nice on the bed and the colors are beautiful.,149
2,"This is my first novel by Mr. Patterson but it took my breath away!!! I just wonder how some readers think of it as ""unrealistic"" cause my husband usually say things like Matt does in the novel. Unless you're not happy who you're with. It will make you realize how you view your life in connection with ""juggling the 5 balls"". Give it to your friends and family. A must-buy!!",375
2,The item came quickly and is exactly as advertised - I am very happy with the service.,86
2,"Watch out if you go on vacation with this book. I took Monti's book along with me on a trip. I ended up laughing out loud on the plane - more than once. And I don't usually burst into laughter while traveling alone. Every time I picked up the book I was glad I did, because Malcolm always ended up in an amazingly awkward situation. Sweep of the Second Hand is very refreshing and clever because the author described Malcolm's life in such a real way. I can't wait for Monti's next work. Who knows what he will think up next!",525

2,"Scott Glen shure knows how to play it cool. Steve Mc Queen cool, but in modern times. The whole movie is a different thing it has a feeling, mostly due to Glens loyality ond respect for his older partner , called ""Higbe"" in the movie. A very nice display of some more ""unknown"" actors and a great ending! Wow I just love it.",324
2,I didn't know what to expect. It's not like the tv show but still a good mystery read for vacation.,99
2,"A very nice chapter book for young readers about a cat who discovers that her purpose is to run a lighthouse and save sailors from the rocky shores.However, the story focuses on more than just the lighthouse, it focuses on how the cat, Pandora, finds friends and a family as the sea brings to her what she had given up for it.",326
2,"The product description gives the story summary and there are quite a few reviews already so I will just add a short note about this since it is one of my favorite GH books and, possibly, the funniest.The girl in disguise as boy has been done many times and -- considering the hero already knows since he has helped the heroine with her disguise and is accompanying her so she can visit her childhood friend --- I almost wonder myself at what has made a story this simple so very charming.",489
2,"We purchased the Superyard as an enclosure for our new puppies. It has been quite an asset during the time we have been weaning the pups. My only regret is that we did not order the two additional sections. In fact, we will be ordering the additional sections so when we have another litter of pups there will be sufficient room. I would recommend this product.",361
2,"I bought the black XL bag. It is a simple and durable bag that does exactly what I want.It has the loops for the shoulder strap, but no shoulder strap.This product would get five stars if it included a shoulder strap.",217
2,Excellent video for fans of Phoenix and of course Barkley.Charles is one of the most controversial players to ever play the game yet one of the most colorful and talented as well.Through the good times and the bad of Barkley's life and career he has always been the center of attention especially in the NBA.A must have for true fans of sports legends.,352
2,This book has changed the way I think about being a mom. I love the GIFTS and study questions after each. The text is completely scriptural based.,146
2,"This book is revenge for ""The Official I Hate Cats Book"" and ""101 Uses For A Dead Cat"". The pictures are rather amusing. Instead of a riding a mechanical bull, there's a cat riding a ""mechanical human"". Cats have found many uses for a dead human: A ""piggy"" bank, a basketball net, dominos, a scarecrow and even a seesaw. It's a light satire and I recommend it to anyone who has a ""cat hater"" in the family.",406
2,"It Looks Great in the picture and all of the materials are HIGH quality, but if you are unsure of you're wiring skills dont buy it because it does not come assembled. EVERYTHING else is TOP-NOTCH QUALITY! I reccomend it, just unpleased when I opened the box to find a bag full of parts.",286
2,"This is one of the books I recommend when people complain about 'Princess Books'. I love Tatterhood, a princess who most certainly does not need to be rescued, and who dresses like a rag basket because she doesn't care one lick what anyone thinks, and would perhaps like to find someone who isn't looking for a superficial princess. Who could not love a princess who rides around on a wild goat whacking hobgoblin heads with a wooden spoon?",440
2,"This film, sequel to THE MUMMY'S HAND, finds Kharis(now played by Lon Chaney Jr.) transported to America to kill off surviving members of the Banning expedition. There is alot of suspense and romance mixed with horror in this film. The only problem is that there is too much stock footage from the previous movie. A great and well deserved finale! Sequel: THE MUMMY'S GHOST",373
2,It's simple to use with my Canon printer.I took pictures of my new grandson with my digital camera -printed them on photo paper and the results were great.A professional photographer made shots for the announcements.They were scrapped and mine were used.,254
2,"Our church's Christian Education Department used this book to teach our 2-5 year olds the 10 commandments. In 12 weeks, the children not only could recite the commandments in order, they could also tell you the commandment indiviually by number - out of order. The book made the memorization of the 10 commandments fun and easy for the children. I recommend book this to every teacher in children's church.",406
2,Purchased these to use in outdoor pet beds. I was very surprised by how well these blankets work to reflect heat back.,118
2,"I was very skeptical about spending this much money on pots & pans. But these pans were soo worth the money. I put them to the test this weekend, when I forgot oil & butter to cook breakfast with. The pan s worked wonders and did not stick when I cooked eggs, italian sausage & hashbrowns. Awesome buy!!",303

2,"The Dwarf Trumpkin tells the children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy)the story of Prince Caspian and how he escaped the castle of Miraz for fear of his life. With the help of Aslan,(the lion)and the children, Caspian defeats Miraz and became the new king of Narnia.",266
2,"I loved the book. I certainly agree that it requires a full suspension of belief, but that has always been the hallmark of these novels. The sense of adventure still seemed present as did the quirky way of looking at the world and the fascination with everything in it. Most (not all) of the books in this series and among my favorite mysteries and I hope Mr. Block writes more on Tanner. I'm guessing those who hated it are fans of Block's darker works, for me, this is just plain fun. (I like the Burglar books too)",517
2,Cinderella was one of my first Disney movies I'd seen as a child - so I was excited to hear that Disney had re-released it again! It's the classic tale of a housemaid turned Princess by believing in her dreams - and in her fairy Godmother.,239
2,"RE the person who thinks its like lemon juice. I beg to differ, Ive used lemon juice and there is no comparison to the Cell Food drops. I used to use lemon juice for detox, so I know what Im talking about. Cell food makes me feel great, and it doesn't take much. Can't take it at night or it will keep me awake for awhile.",322
2,"Night Train is truley one of the most swinging, hippest, and greatest jazz albums I've ever heard. The band plays so tight together that if you put a piece of coal on the bandstand, you would get a diamond. Buy this album! It is a ""must have."" Warning: You may have to wear a seatbelt while listening to it, because you'll definitely be up and dancing if you're not strapped down. Enjoy!!!!!!!",393
2,"I am a middle school teacher who never sits at my desk. I purchased this anti-fatigue mat after reading others' reviews. It is absolutely an awesome product! I refer to it as my ""magic carpet"" in the classroom. My students find opportunities to stand on it themselves. What a relief this is for those of us who spend a great amount of time standing at work. This is a great product!",382
2,"This book provides a decent overview of the different aspects of computer/information security, and is an easy read, but if you are a software developer or IT professional, you may want to consider purchasing a few more specialized books instead.",246
2,I was quite surprised when I started reading this book at how entertaining the stories were. Anne Seagraves follows the lives of a hand full of women in the 1800's. The stories have vivid detail that really take a person back in time. I had picked up a dozen historical books at the library to study the period. This doesn't read like a history book. Anne has a gift for storytelling apparent in the book.,405
2,"But I couldnt. This was actually a pretty decent flick. I havent seen the vampire one so I cant compare it but the story was a lot better then I had expected and the .07 cents I paid to watch it was well worth it. Seriously, this is a movie to watch when you want to have fun. It reminds me of a lot of horror movies I used to watch in the early 90s from Charles Band and the Troma guys. I enjoyed it from beginning to the end.",427
2,This product is worth the price it has lasted longer than two of my brushes and a sponge. it does tend to absorb the make up but if you let it absorb some water then it works like a dream,187
2,"I actually really liked this film. It was a little slow to start, but I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It's a slow paced film and very true to life. Jennifer Lawrence gives an amazing performance. Has a neat ending.",224
2,Love this book. Excellent treatment of the conditions and effects of grief. Lewis' treatment on the subject is so humanly experienced yet ultimately transcendent of it.Rosalie,175
2,"Robot Chicken is one of those series people either LOVE or HATE, I happen to be on the love side, but I don't think you could ever convince someone to enjoy it if they didn't. This is a great send-up of the Star Wars movies, so if you are a Star Wars nerd like me, it's probably worth a watch even if you have never seen Robot Chicken, and if you are a fan of the series, you don't need my help deciding whether you like it or not.",431
2,this series is very good. patrick stewart is an amazing actor. i have always enjoyed the star trek tv series,108
2,"I love this, the sound quality is good and it is comfortable to wear. However I have to wear it upside down, with the metal half-hoop under my chin. The size of this is not adjustable. It is still perfectly comfortable under the chin but I gave it four stars instead of five for the no-adjustment feature. The jack it comes with is standard and fits almost anything; should you have something wierd it dosn't fit a few dollars at Radio Shack will get you an adapter.My neighbors really love this too, in my condo. They can't hear my TV anymore!!...lol",551
2,Get this for any artists or musicians you know who are having a baby. The book has a poetic tone and lots of space for writing in comments far more personal and sweet than the typical height/weight/tooth stuff. Beautiful!,221
2,"I agree with all the other 5 star reviews. I have told all my friends about this toaster/egg cooker/breakfast sandwich maker. They are ordering one too. How fun and easy to be able to get your own egg mcmuffin at home. I use the whole grain muffins and brown fresh eggs, Canadian bacon from Sam's and cheese if I'm in the mood. I hate boiling eggs so this will make that extra easy. How much more could you want? Doing the happy dance.",435
2,"This product is great, no need for batteries and gives a substantial radio broadcast, and is a must have for anyone who experiences power outages.",146
2,"I love this magazine, but the great price I had for the first year was not the price I was charged when it renewed. The renewal notice I received said that they could not guarantee the same price, but it might be the same, so I had to commit to the renewal before I knew what the charge would be. Of course it was more than twice what the first year was!",354
2,Gift for step mother. She loved. I think my dad got some that night.,68
2,"This is about the best CD that we own. It has some of the older Hawaiian music & some of the newer music. We play it all the time. Now that we are on a long vacation it is nice to have this good music with us. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, you will not be disappointed. Enjoy!!!",295
2,"I liked it more than all the individual movies because of the interaction of the different characters, plus it was sort of funny. Casting was good and, although I feel Edward Norton was the perfect Hulk, I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo.",227
2,I love these book plates! So sweet and elegant!It just looks so nice in all my books and when people borrow them they know that this one belongs to me!Lovely!,158
2,mad butcher is a texas chainsaw massacre kinda thing.you get to see pretty girls nakes and betty to and see is pretty this film is a little gross cause he cuts the girls naked bodies piece to piece and people eat them.,218
2,"I received my nail polish quickly and was very happy with it, as I expected I would be. Zoya nail polish is long lasting and beautiful, no matter what color you get. ""Jem"" is a beautiful DARK maroon/fushia/red/purple shimmer. It's VERY similar in color to OPI's ""Shoot for the Maroon"", but is a much smoother formula than OPI and stays on longer. I will only buy Zoya from now on.",380
2,"I bet the last person who posted was first in line to cash his 6 bucks though right? Make some sense dude, seriously. Your crying because you say you didnt get enough back, well how much in taxes did you PAY into before the tax credit!? Thought so.Good book overall. Sean has alot of topics correct. Sometimes I cant take his strong conservative beliefs. Sean, take a breathe once in a while will you!? A little too much preaching but overall a good read.",455
2,"This is a nice stock that will make your beat up enfield look great, even though it says its a direct drop in replacement you will have to do some sanding or some slight drememl work to the stock to get it to fit correctly, like sanding the forearm to float the barrel and i had to sand under the safety so the receiver would sit all the way down, it was preventing my clip from going in like it should i was having to hit it pretty hard to lock it in place, but once thats done it is a great stock for the price.",513
2,"The nifty fifty is an excellent lens that I highly recommend.However, I do not recommend Adorama. Long story short - they ripped me off. Lots of vendors out there without needing to use Adorama.",194
2,"This book has one particular section titled ""Heaven on Earth,"" which avidly depicts the sublime religious influences that faith and church can have on young low-income Americans, and how their view of God and Church can become more depicted by those around them than by actual mature thought. This book was a required reading for my college level English course, and I would suggest it to any student of English or Culture.",423
2,"As much as I would like to I am dubious about buying this item as it was not due until the end of 07.As the price tag of $145.00, I would hate to wind up with an inferior set for that cost. Can anyone assure me that it is the OFFICIAL release, arriving early. Whenever it does, Hallelujah!!!",291
2,"I bought this CD, not knowing what to expect. Tool has always been one of my favorite bands, but not having heard anything new from them in years made me wonder if they'd changed in the interim. Well, the simple fact is they have: they've gotten better. I am absolutely amazed at the depth of this music, it's completely overwhelmed me. I'm going to have to listen many more times just to absob the sheer vastness of this CD, but it's already become one of my favorite CDs, and I have a feeling it will stay that way.",517
2,"These shoes are light and comfortable to wear for a long day of work / walk. The lambskin lining is especially nice on your feet, initially. Priced at $50ish, the shoes are affordable. However, after 2 months of ~2 days per week, the cushion beneath the lambskin lining looses its ""lift."" Along with the proletarian finish, these shoes are perfect for a day out in the field, not in a business setting. One should not pay more than $50 for this pair.",450
2,"Wow!Rob Thomas has an excellent voice and this song is so uplifting. It has certainly inspired me to get back into songwriting.Great chorus, great riffs.Very Rob Thomas, very catchy.Not a bad movie either.P",206
2,"Too many reviews focus on the mix and production value, rather than the music! This CD is one of my favorite, as the songs span his career, and therefore have songs that could be on several of his older CDs. My favorites are XO and Either/Or, and I wasn't crazy about the Basement CD. I was hesitant to but this one, but I elated how amazing these songs are. BTW, the mix is great!",381
2,"Not a fad diet book but one that has proven the test of time, with scientific research and success stories to back it up.",121
2,"I found it a little plodding at first, but then I had trouble putting it down. It was interesting, enlightening, and entertaining (a lot of unanticipated little giggles). The portions devoted to the construction of the transcontinental railroad are far superior to Ambrose's book on that subject.",296
2,very nice picture key bob. Was going to buy three of them but order got messed up. Would recommend it to others.,112
2,"I purchased this product to replace another one that had worn out. I thought the new one was the same, as the photos looked the same and they are made by the same company. However, the new one is considerably flimsier though it does the job intended.",250
2,"My son is three and really likes these tapes. Some of the information is a bit advanced, but the videos are well written and he learns a lot by watching the pictures. We watched the Astronaut tape probably 25 times after we got the set before he wanted to watch another one. There are seven tapes with two episodes/careers on each tape. And the scripts are not hokey or silly. They're serious, but fun to watch. It's easy to watch these with my son without counting the minutes until it's over like some other tapes we have. I definately recommend this set.",557
2,"I have this and also purchased the kitchen aid KHB100 when it was on sale. The KHB100 had multispeed which admittedly was buckets of fun, but since they both get the job done, speed doesn't matter that much. However if you want to know, the lowest setting on the KHB was probably about equal to the speed on the cuisinart. The locking mechanism on the cuisinart feels easier to lock in place than the KHB which has 2 buttons instead of 1 and needs a bit more force. In the end the cuisinart is ~2/3 the price of the KHB, so you can't go wrong.",543
2,This make my hair nice and soft. I haven't used it long enough to see if it will thicken my hair - which is why I bought it..,125
2,"This book is a fantastic read from start to finish. The ONLY issue I have is that the character Omaha could have been a little less Indiana Jones. Having his name be a State, and the author actually call him ""Indiana"" by one of the other characters is really not necessary. Other than that, I loved the whole book, and I loved the end. It will hook you in to the Sigma series.",376
2,"In this easy to read book, you can learn how to make your life, business and home run more practically, with more organization, thus causing you less stress, and letting you get more done. If you are looking for a way to add more hours to your day, this is the book for you.Pam and Doug outline specific tools you can use to manage your time and energy creating the success and peace of mind we all need!",404

2,"It has been years since I have been able to purchase this foundation and let me tellyou that ITS THE BEST! The long lasting coverage foundations today dont come close to this. This is the best there is. BUY IT! Buy as many as you can. This covers flawlessly. Scars, acne, dark circles and let me tell you it goes on lightcoverage but a heavy coverage. Its the best. USE IT WET! Wet sponge, and pat the product and then lightly smooth. Its easy. It is amazing and you cant go wrong.",481
2,Had to find a replacement carafe quickly and this was it. Arrived sooner than expected and started brewing right away.,118
2,"Remember one thing about the Big Tymers,,,, they aren't rappers, they are GAME SPITTERS! No this isnt a great album, but it a very solid release. All of The Hot Boys (juvenile, bg, turk, and lil wayne) are on a bunch of tracks. The beats are all good. The Big Tymers (Baby and Fresh) might not have the skill of Juvenile or B.G. as rappers, but behind great production by Mannie Fresh they are able to ""spit game"" and keep you listening. An above average release from the great Cash Money Records.",497

2,"We bought this card game as a Christmas gift for our son and we've played it several times since then with our entire family. We all love it! It's a game that requires strategy, planning ahead, and working together with other players. I highly recommend this game.",264
2,"If you want the complete works on a budget, this is the best choice. It's the full Arden text, with a good glossary at the end of the book. Each play begins with a brief introductory note. You don't get the extensive footnotes of the individual Arden plays, but for many readers, that's a bonus.",295
2,"An exceptional movie which promted me to research and read more about the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan. There are three other earlier movies from Taiwan, 'Finding Sayun,' 'The Sage Hunter' and 'Waiting for the Flying Fish.' It would be great if these were available from Amazon.",278
2,"I purchased this for my mother-in-law in assisted living. It's a basic phone, works well, and she likes it. Amazon is a godsend for those of us that need to buy items for elderly relatives in other parts of the country. My mom is 100, my mom-in-law is 90. Thank you Amazon for making it possible for us to make their lives a little better.",339
2,The performances are unbelievable! The behind scenes show what they like to do on the road also things you've probably never known about the group. If you like matchbox 20 this video will make you love them and if you love them it's going to make you love them even more. I love it and recommend it to anyone!,309
2,"I heard this song about a week ago from one of my friends who has it, and its definitely one of the best songs that ive heard in a while. I think its about as good, if not better than Feel It, another song that they have. Which also is worth getting.",250
2,"An amazing amount of useful information packed into a booklet not much bigger than the average camera manual.This is one book that is to be found permanently stashed in my camera bag while out in the African bushveld.Particularly noteworthy are the chapters dealing with lenses, exposure, film types and composition. When in the field, I find myself often referring to the chapter on exposure, which is one of the clearest most concise expositions I have ever seen on the subject.",480
2,"This is a good and short book to read. This book is about a girl in Japan after the atom bomb was drop. Sadako, the girl, later founds out that she has leakemia because of the A-bomb radiation.Her brother tells her a legend, if you make a thousand paper cranes, you can make a wish. The book is also base on a true story.",321
2,"Bought it as i liked the amount of rubber on the handle, figured it would be safer and easier to pour. It is. Heats quickly, feels sturdy without being overly heavy. Only tradeoff for the great handle is that you cannot move it off to the side to fill it, but not a big deal.",275

2,"Overall this is a great CD, with high-quality recordings of great music. I was a little surprised, though, that it doesn't include one of my favorite pieces of music used in the movie: 'Berceuse' from Gabriel Fauré ""Dolly Suite"", which was used in the scene where Little Miss teaches Andrew to play the piano.",309
2,"We bought four for our church. They were extremely easy to assemble, arrived promptly (free shipping) and were not even scratched in shipping. The chairs are sturdy and a wide-enough base to preven tipping. We will buy again.",225
2,This collection of new and classic articles provides a thorough survey to the new institutionalism in Sociology. The introduction is a very broad ranging and exciting survey of recent writings in the social sciences on institutions.

2,"Bought it for my 9 year old who has tough time getting going. The alarm is too much! Way too loud. But the vibrating alternative is great-wakes her without overwhelming her. She likes the colorful numbers and they give off a comforting glow. It is bigger than I expected but she likes the heart shape, color and 'jeweled' contol buttons, which she can use herself very easily.",376
2,Love love love how she wrote this book. Good for both men and women alike. I like how she referred to the Word and also used her own personal experienced to relate to the audience.,180

2,"My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved the table and chair set. It is the first Christmas gift that she went for!! Her father, my son had no problems with assembly, and everything was numbered and easy to follow. The only thing that I was a little disappointed with is that there were no screw caps/dollies which did take a little bit away from the looks of the chairs as they stuck out in the backs of all of the chairs.. Otherwise, for the money, it was made very well and seems to be very sturdy.",498
2,"I don't know what else to say that has not been said before. I have wanted to see this movie for quite some time and not sure why. I must say after watching the Fight Club, I found it one of the most interesting films ever. The story, camera and acting of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were excellent. True there is violence, but it was the right amount given the story. Absolutely one of the top 20 films of all time. Watch it you'll not be disappointed.",453

No more excuses for not wearing your belt. :o)I did not encounter the negative qualities that some have written about here. I highly recommend this product.",317
2,This guy is a total nut - driven beyond all reason - and it finely caught up with him after he finished this book - he's now dead. An unbelievable story of what a man can do if he is determined enough. It is not a great piece of literature but rather a great story that is made greater by the fact that it's true.,313
2,"I really really enjoyed this CD. It was very good. My favorite song is Dammit, and I also like Enthused.",104
2,"This Art of Life is a must have. Bob Marley reveals The Way, The Truth and The Life. I have been anxiously awaiting the release of the Time Will Tell on DVD. Thank You for this exceptional presentation of a Legend.",214
2,"I had been buying Oops for years, carrying a little bottle of it in my toolkit for whenever I needed to remove a label or just use as a general solvent. The great thing about Oops used to be that it was gentle on many plastic surfaces of which other solvents would damage or dull the finish. Recently, Homax changed the formula to make it stronger, but that made it worthless to me because now it damages plastic surfaces. I won't buy the new formula. BTW, this is an edited review. I first gave it 5 stars, but now would only give it 1 star.",542

2,"Great translation of the classic CAPCOM fighter. Some small effects are missing(swinging rails on the subway, level transition seens), and the normal NINTENDO censorship(no women thugs). Capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music, but should have kept the original scores. Sound effects are perfect, even better than the SNES, and up to par with the original arcade. Graphics are awesome, Cody, Guy, and Haggar are done well.",427
2,"This has been a great game to add to our small collection of Wii games. It is something that is fun to play and fun to watch. My kids have a bunch of the songs memorized, and they beg to play it. It is a big timewaster, so it makes me crazy some days, but most video games are timewasters, I guess! Great game, great fun!!",322
2,"Berkowitz has really nailed Hell's Kitchen. You can smell the smells, hear the noise, even feel the damp coldness. I couldn't put this book down. Although short in length, it is long on story line, and generously sprikled with humor and wisecracks. You will laugh out loud, and also be very engrossed in the story. I highly recommend this book. It is not your run of the mill murder mystery",390
2,"Our children loved it. This is one the best Pooh films yet. A great lesson in personal strengths and learning about yourself and your fears. Beautiful animation, silly Pooh fun. ""Everyone can find something to like."" Pooh Bear is always a hit, and this adventure kept the kids on the edge of their seats. They sang and hummed the tunes. ""Christopher Robin said I am smarter than I think."" ""It was so much fun to watch, it had such nice music in it, we really loved it."" Best for ages 2 to 5.",491
2,"Book is great - helping those in need should flow from the heart, not from the textbooks.Quality was ""so-so"" - bad spill on the side.",133
2,"This camera has everything an amateur photographer could need. Lots of features that are similar to my Canon rebel G SLR camera, which makes it easy to use right out of the box. The pictures are very clear and stunning, and can be blown up quite large.The only complaint would be night-time shots, but most digital cameras can't handle night time shots very well.",363
2,"This sub is a great value. I was replacing a blown speaker in an Avalon, not looking to have lots of bass. This speaker has more bass than the factory speaker from Toyota. After shopping around, this was well worth the money I paid.",232
2,That guy who said nirvana was the worst band to ever happen to music doesn't know what he is talkling about. Nirvana is one of if not the best bands ever. This cd sounds like it was a bootleg cause it all sounds like one preformance not like song then stop then another song. Its like it would be if you were there and that is what makes it cool. If you never got to see them in concert this is then next best thing.,416

2,"Ilyich wrote this a generation-plus ago, yet his messages resonate today. We have depersonalized our lives in so many ways, by bringing the industrial model into realms that were meant for emotion, feeling, and art. The influx of industry-thought into medicine has torn the sensitive heart from many care-givers and patients alike. His text is a bit lengthy and is repetitive in spots, and can be challenged on the facts in others. Overall, his concerns about the choices we have made socially and medically remain valid.",521

2,"This is not an overall review. Instead, it is a mini-review prompted by the desire to further what we must assume to be one of the book's purposes, namely to promote correct usage.Much, maybe a majority, of the text is one-sentence examples. The use of examples is the main instructional technique. It sure is unfortunate that the reader is badly instructed by one of the examples.I hope that you caught the intentional error in the previous sentence. It is the same error that struck me when I read an example that contained it.",529

This story is about a dboy named Marty, his dog named Shiloh and Judd Travers. In his story Marty finds Shiloh and wants to keep him , on the other hand Judd was abusing Shiloh.

2,"My mother forced me to read this book, and I'm so glad she did. This book was great. The meaning of the book goes way beyond the rape trial, so I suggest that if you didn't like it, read it again! It will make more sense. I recommend this book to everyone.",256
2,"Nice looking. kind of like buying a happy meal, the surprise is the seeing which one is inside. the color and style is a crap shoot. i wanted oak but got maple. might buy 5 hoping one is the color i want then return the rest.

The cards themselfes are also really cool 'cause they have amazing artwork and cool desines. Playing the game is so fun, and I think that other kids should drop dumb games like ""Yu gi oh"" and ""pokymen""(I'm suprised that theres kids that even collect those any more!?). This is both a family and a freind game, and I love it!!... {=)",492
2,"I can't imagine recording a movie/program to keep and not being able to edit out the commercials, so I only use RAM discs. They're hard to find sometimes tho, so I guess others don't feel that way. I'm just glad I can get them somewhere.",237
2,Amazing debut effort by Daughtry! I haven't enjoyed a CD this much in a very long time. I find myself having a new favorite song from this CD on a daily basis. I can honestly say I enjoy every song on the CD and haven't used my skip or forward button yet! I highly recommend this album.,286
2,"I ordered it a year ago, because I did not want to use dryer for my clothes. and I also did not want to use humidifier.my friends liked it and I ordered twice this instead of my friendsand both are like it",205
2,"This is a great thing for zapping bugs. The bees in the summer are dreadful, but I can always get them with the Bug Zapper. Have given this for gifts and everyone has liked them.",178
2,"This has been a pretty good lens hood for me, the only drawback has been that when I shoot at 17 mm (using my 17-85mm Canon lens) the hood sometimes shows up in the corner of my photos. Perhaps it's because I'm not using a full-frame camera (I have a Canon 40D) or I have screwed it up somehow but it is an occasional problem. The hood seems very well-made, though, definitely a higher-quality construction than some non-Canon hoods that I have.",445
2,"I'd never heard of James Tipper until I heard about this CD on a newsgroup. I rarely buy CD's based on one song but I did this time and was very suprised. It has lots of different styles and moods so you don't get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of CD's. There's something for everyone. I like the techno sounding stuff like Bioluminescence and Evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano. Lyrics are great and there are clever production touches. Overall, money well spent.",527
2,"I bought a spool of this line to use in my Echo string trimmer that has the ""Two string insertable trimming head"". This is the strongest, toughest, longest lasting trimmer string that I have ever used.One problem that I can see is for the manufacturer in that it lasts twice as long as the orange line and I will not need to replace it near as often.",350
2,I used this book for an OS course i took at a community college. The subject matter is voluminous and the book covers it pretty well. I wish there were solutions to the many exercise problems. This will surely help in the learning process. Some authors/publishers provide additional resources on a student companion website. While the book does have such a site - the content is not very useful at all (just a bunch of ppt slides summarizing each chapter!).Overall a great book. I learnt a lot about OS without much of a CS background,534
2,"I bought this book for my mother who just loves the Jan Karon Mitford series. She is now into the 4th or 5th Dearest Dorothy book and says they are just as good. Gentle, friendly and hometowny.",193
2,One of her best every. It is a can't put down book. This book is AWESOME!!!!!! It will keep you wondering till the end.,119
2,"We love to play UNO all the time. We had the traditional card game and lost some of the cards, so we decided to buy another UNO but we wanted it water proof, this is the one. Now we can play and don't have to worry if the cards get wet. We are all very happy and having a lot of fun.",283
2,"I've always been somewhat skeptical with these microwavable items, but this is a GREAT little item to have! Fast and easy! I received mine yesterday and had to test it right away. 8 minutes for medium cooked centers (using jumbo eggs) and 10 minutes for hard. The bottom is hot, so use a towel or something to handle it once you are ready to remove it from the microwave.",371
2,"The stock HB's rock, the neck is fast, and the finish is great. However, I customized mine with a pair of p-94ss and a Maestro tailpiece. This makes for a much better guitar.",174
2,I was looking for something to use in my coupon binder and these work great I love to use the pockets to hold coupons that don't fit in my coupon sleeves. The colors are very bright and easy to use. I would recommend these to any avid couponer or student,254
2,"I wanted to get lost in the story of this book. I couldn't put it down. The characters were quirky, sweet, and a little naughty. What a darling book. Keep writing Marian. I can't get enough of your books.",204
2,"It's a little late, but we still have our hopes up for recieving the kit. From The description of the funnel cake kit, Both my wife and I believe the kit is well worth waiting for.",180
2,"Overall a good product at a fair price. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but simple and clear to use and interpret the results. There's a reason TIMEX has been around for such a long time! Very happy with purchase, using it almost every day.",241
2,"this walker is light weight and easy to assemble and use. No heavy lifting required. It is also adjustable, so that no matter how short or how tall a person is, they can use it with no bending over. It is also great, for those of us that need a little extra help getting off the commode. I would also recommend it.",314
2,"This book is for those of you who yearn for a very different approach to a story - it is a bit of time to clue into the approach the author is taking, but that only adds to the experience of this book ... I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys books with a bit of a twist.",276
2,"The question of ""who's best?"" is a subjective one. My opinion after listening to all of the New Flamenco (New Age) guitarists is: They are all great and have their own distinctive styles, but Govi is king.",205
2,I ordered this DVD for my daughter and granddaughter. I was very pleased with the price and delivery. They were happy with the quality.,135
2,"A lot of people are trying to make Bo look bad. I've talked to many people who have purchased the album and they said that they loved it. He sings very catchy music on here. I agree about him needing more individuality, but it isn't bad at all. Carrie's debut was awesome as well. What does us old people know, just putting my word out about Bo.",345
2,"I always thought British show is very boring but after watching Monarch of the Glen, it changed my thinking.... This show is great and funny! Furthermore, it has nice scenery as well.... I am always crazy about Highlands, etc ^_^ I will definitely go for Season 3, 4 and 5.....Oh yeah, their British accent is ""cute""!",317
2,"Hoosier Hill Farm 8"" popcorn bags are excellent for a single serving! These popcorn bags are a great accessory to any popcorn popper.",133

2,"This thing is nothing special, but it was solid for how inexpensive it was. Kinda reminded me of the ones at the minigolf courses. Generic and simple, but solid.",161
2,not only a mans book but a womens book. the book pulls at your heart strings. the trails and tribulations of milts life on the field and off the field. and what the players had to go through that era and how they paved the way for the players of today to reap the benefits that they recieve today.the players of today dont give a dam about old ballplayers and what milt and the ballplayers did for them. all they care is about themselves. would be an excellent movie.,467
2,I am useing the RTV-44 as a surround set to compliment my Bic DV 62 mains and Polk Sub.They are driven by Sony STR DH 810 Receiver. They sound Great!,149
2,Although the author describes many different angles on the role of sex and frequency this book has got to be one of the very best I've ever read on any topic. I'm seriously considering getting ahold of the author and requesting a reprint. Excellent book!,254
2,this was a gift aswell to someone who enjoys games of this sort.theyre truly pleased w. it and i couldnt be happier either !,124
2,Junie B Jones books have been a hit at our home for many years thru many children. I would highly recommend.,108

2,"I love Tiffen, I only run Tiffen it's the best. Hers why1. Good quality2. Great price3. Great filter styles4. Good company",122
2,"I enjoyed reading The Dahl Family Album, and looking at the pictures. Although most of these vacations took place well before my time, I enjoyed the comments of my ""older"" cousins about our dearly departed Aunt Bertha. She was a real ""gem"", and I'm glad her memory was preserved in this book. Also, may we never forget the time my mother-Karla Drexler and her sister, Virginia Clark, and her husband Emory Clark had food poisoning. How often has my mom recalled that she was ""sick as a dog"" on that trip! Fond memories for those who experience sickness on vacation!",565
2,My husband asked me to get this for him while he was deployed. He was glad to get it and it was exactly what he was expecting. Nice size. Not too big and not too small. He has never had a problem with camelbak products.,219
2,"This can opener is great. We have been using a corded one for years but did not like leaving it out on the counter. So, we had to find a place for the old one in a cabinet and get it out when we needed to open a can. Plus, we could only open the cans in one location. With the cordless can opener, we can now open cans anywhere we like. We also take it with us when we work the concession stands at ball games. And with it's compactness, it doesn't take up much space and conveniently sits out of site in the corner.",516
2,Truly an epic documentary it made a great gift for my family now living in Alsaka. Service as always was right on time,118
2,"i thought this book would never end but it eventually did.The first few chapters were boring,but then it got cofusing,then interesting,i guess if you like books were they switch bodys is cool but not 2 me its just plan creepy (...)",231
2,"Although there wasn't much directly useful to my situation (Public middle school in Korea. I have classes of nearly 40 students and see each class once per week), the book helped me get an idea of what my role was going to be and what I needed to do in order to prepare. I have even been able to adapt a few of the activity ideas into my monster-sized classes. Personally, I would like to see a longer discussion about having large class sizes, and strategies for dealing with them, but obviously no one can write a book perfectly catered to everyone.",551
2,This works out your whole body and with 5 pound weights is excellent! It is fastand it is easy to learn the moves. I have four copies - never want to bewithout it.,163
2,"THESE LAMPS ARE JUST BEAUTIFUL - SOFT, BUT ADJUST UP FOR READING VERY PLEASED AND RECEIVED IN RECORD TIME",105
2,"This story of an outsider viewing contemporary American society is a classic. Finding those special good people if we look. It will not go out of style.It tells a simple story covering up a solid theme. Adventure, compassion, characterization.Don't forget to read it to your kids!",280
2,"My 2 years old daughter loves her Dora pillow. I put it on the rocking chair for her to find it, as a surprise and she was so happy to find it that she dropped (instantly) a toy she was carrying and ran to ger her Dora pillow. She sleeps with her, it is like having a little buddy !",282
2,"It really captivates you. You could sit there for hours listening to it and not get bored. I really recommend these tapes. The one problem is that it's a little varied from the book and a little harder to understand, but overall really good.",241
2,This album is one of the best. It contains some of MWS's best songs as well as two new ones: Do You Dream Of Me is a heartfelt love-ballad and Kentucky Rose a moving country-style song.,185
2,"An excellent all-purpose fry pan and a good value for the price. Comfortable to handle, and a nice weight without being too heavy to handle easily. T-Fal fry pans sold in the ""big-box"" stores don't seem to have the same sturdy ""feel"" as this one. Not sure if a professional restaurant chef would use it - but for home use I would recommend it without hesitation. The rim of the pan is not non-stick, so every once in a while some food might stick to the rim. Minor inconvenience.",479
