1,"Initial charge took about 3 hours. Batteries and charger got quite warm, maybe normal first time around.Looks nice and easy to use. Thumbs up.After using the unit and batteries for a while now I finally trashed it. Had to recharge everytime before using and batteries would run down in less than a week without use. Gave a full charge, checked voltage and set out on desk for 7 days and they died without even using. Wouldn't buy Sony batteries again, cheap $ store batteries last a lot longer. Wasted money . . .",513
1,"I kept looking at my watch. I kept thinking, ""this seems like a good time for the movie to end."" But it didn't. Like the Energizer Bunny, it kept on and on. I tried to like it, really I did, but I found it to be pretentious fluff, lengthy at that. It simply took too long to get to whatever was supposed to be the point. As I left the theatre, I just knew the critics were going to love it.",390
1,"I've used this battery backup for less then a year and it no longer works. When the power goes off, so does everything plugged into this Tripp Lite battery backup. THEN the battery backup kicks in and starts beeping. Real useful. Total waste of money and could ruin your expensive computer equipment when you think that you are being protected from power surges and outages.",374
1,This flag is very cheap in construction. Flag itself is very thin and could never be used on a moving vehicle as it would surely shred very quickly. The field of my flag also has a stain on it.,193
1,"But I thought it was the whole season of Ponderosa, but it was only half the season. I was very disappointed, but still enjoyed the episodes I did get!",151
1,"I thought this was going to be a great book on designing a play area for the kids, but I was truly disappointed. There are great ideas in this book, but anyone looking for a ""build it yourself"" guide needs to keep looking as there are no directions to be found; only listings on how to order the ""blueprints"" of the various items you wanted directions on how to build in the first place.As I said, this book has some great ideas, just no directions included.",458
1,I found it to be useless. It did not even have enough power to suck up an ant.,78
1,Don't waste your money!! I can not even explain how BAD this video is... Half the video is this gentleman showing you how to anchor the bands?? and from there i just gets worse...,179
1,"As a huge long time T-Bone Burnett fan (I saw him in Austin in '83 or '84), I was eagerly awaiting the newest CD. I was very disappointed. The songs were just not that good. I found the CD ponderous and claustrophobic (but I am not thrilled with Sam Phillips, so take it for what it's worth). I have only listened to it twice (so I am giving it one more listen), but I urge people to purchase Twenty Twenty. An excellent album with a good booklet to go along with it.",467
1,1. You can't use protectors.2. A mat & deck box would be easier.3. It's as heavy as someone standing on your arm.4. It is hard to put cards in the last slots.5. You will be laughed at and bullied.,196

1,"My wife and I heard the Dixie Chicks on Good Morning America performing two of the songs from their new album. All of the political drama aside, the songs I heard were nothing more than contemporary pop country garbage. My wife, who is more of a Chicks fan than I agreed that it did not even sound like their type of music. Their first two albums showed merit and a touch of true country style. I wouldn't be surprised to see this album hitting the bargain bin very soon.",471
1,"Was trying to write a mumps interpreter. This book ended up being not so useful. Early in the book, he has a completely wrong definition of ""bootstrap loader."" This bothered me, because mumps is such an old language, you would think someone that knows mumps would know about the meaning of that phrase. In any case, I believe the author knows Mumps completely, but I did not find the book energizing or inspiring.",413
1,"I have to rate the product according to my experience. I ended up being allergic to the main ingredient in this product. It was way too strong for my skin and I quickly began to start scratching for no apparent reason to me and having weird burning sensations, etc. on my face. I would recommend that you make sure your skin can handle this ingredient before purchasing this product.",383
1,These timers are horrible. They are not worth FREE ... if they gave them away you would NOT want one. They are problematic and setting them is beyond hard. Don't make the mistake of trying one.,193
1,"You cannot compare the foreign film with the much wasted American version.It was not even worth the $.99 (cents) I paid to watch this movie.They should have named it ""The Girl with the Wagon Tattoo"" and made it into a comedy movie with Jack Black and Daisy Fuentes.Uugh.",270
1,"One of the worst soundtracks I've ever bought, simply for the fact that they put all the damn movie quotes into the songs.WHY?! Why would they do this?! This is a MUSICAL SCORE - not a damn sound board! I cannot express myself angrily enough. I am sorely sorry I spent money on this piece of crap. I wanted music, not the movie, that's why I bought the MUSIC.",359
1,"Rocafella has truly fell off. I've never really been a Bleek fan but this has to be Bleek's worst album. I did not think he can do worse than MADE but it looks like I was wrong! NEwayz if I were you i wouldn't even take my time to listen to the album if it weren't for one song ""Dear Summer"" and Bleeks not even on it just Hov.",327
1,"I expected the artwork to be similar to Tom Cross, but this ended up being a bunch of poems that don't even rhyme. Nice pics but the best image is on the cover which is the one we see here on amazon. The rest are not what I expected at all.",240
1,"If you're an absolute newbe, this is probably a good book for you.If you have any experience at all, pass on this one.",118
1,Waste of money. The fabric is very thin & not very soft. My daughter takes naps in the pack n play. I bought these because I was worried about using a sheet that's too big. All the SIDS warnings say 'only used approved snug fitting sheets.' Well because this sheet is so thin I have to place a burp cloth or towel under her anyway. So I could have saved $10 and just put a towel down.,384
1,"Have always purchased gold toe socks. Although listed as my size, these socks were made with less material - they were not as tall going up the calf and did not stay up like they used to. I compared these to ""older"" gold toe socks and these were definitely made with less material and not as good. Seems to be a ""cost cutting effort"" on the manufacturer??? Will not buy them again.",381
1,"Quite simply, the hiss/chirp that frequently occurs (sorta reminds you of playing a scratched CD) is irritating enough that you'll switch off your iPod. I bought this for a 2,000-mi road-trip and stopped using it after about 100 miles into the trip. Neither switching frequencies nor moving the iPod/wiring all around helped.Luckily, the car I used on my last road-trip had an AUX input (direct iPod to audio-jack connection) so I only used this gadget to keep the iPod charged. Ended up using the iPod the entire 4,600-mi trip!",528
1,"I don't undertand the hype...and found the musical fairly uninteresting. Now the ""drowsy"" part makes sense.",107
1,"I like Jackie Chan, so I keep getting suckered into these cheezy films hoping for something better. Even my teenage son who loves martial arts will not watch it...buyers beware!",177
1,"I can't believe I wasted all that time on a movie that was not worthwhile. The storyline is BORING. It's predictable and drags on and on and on. As far as the action goes, it's a disappointment, compared to the other recent Donnie Yen movies. Only reason I watched this is for him, since they put his name on the top of the casting list but he only plays a relatively minor role in the movie. Not recommended. Don't waste your time.",432
1,"It's dawson creek meeting scary movie. I was wondering if this movie was a horror or a comedy. The acting is so bad, the killer is laughable in his/her disguisement.The dialogue is ridiculous.My opinion is : it's not derisive enough to be a great comedy and not serious enough to make you scared ! So what is it ? It's like the director wanted to make a comedy but his sense of humour wasn't good enough.Also it's so predictible. I knew who was the killer as soon as all the characters have been introduced (there is not enough possibilities indeed).SKIP THIS ONE !",565
1,"I bought this in X-Large for my 65 lb pitbull. It was WAY too small. After ""forcing"" it on, he was clearly uncomfortable and unable to walk correctly. The ""legs"" just ride up and get stuck near the dogs chest. When he is walking, you can't see any of the costume anyway, because it is all facing the ground. Bad pattern. Cheap material. I can't imagine this fitting any dog, regardless of size. Don't waste your money.",418
1,The exercises in this dvd are awkward. I have attempted to do the exercises several time with no result. Iwould not purchase this dvd again.,140
1,"Note that this version has been cut by 20 minutes (the full-length version is also available here on Amazon), i.e. there is no reason at all to be interested in this version unless, for reasons that can be known only to yourself, you have the truly wierd desire to see a Jess Franco movie with the squelchy bits cut out.",320
1,"I've been subscribing to Time magazine for as long as I can remember. Liked the newsweekly format. They have shifted their editorial focus so far to the left over the last few years that I'm finally pulling the plug. I want the news, not left wing ideology. Adios to Time magazine.",281
1,"This book is terrible, may be worth buying for the comic relief. I can't believe anyone does this--or that anyone would have so much free time on their hands and so little life that they would think of these techniques! You should see some of the thing they suggest. I saw the author on Rosie , and wasn't sure if he was serious or not so I checked out the book. I think he's serious. He says he's an MD--hm, hope he's a little better at treating patients.",456
1,I bought this set looking for 1080p. when i pluged in my xbox360 and turned on the 1080p option it did no work. i then looked in the tv manual to find that there is no mention of 1080p it stopped at 1080i. sucks huh,215
1,"I bought this book, but sent it back immediately. Unless you're a screenplay-writing-student, this book is of little value to you. It literally goes like this:Man screams: AARGH! Woman cries: What are you doing? Couple leaves room.All in all: think carefully if this is what you need. Don't buy it just for the scary cover!",323
1,"Ipod cover ordered was NOT what was shipped. It was an imitation and not an original EZ Skin. It did not have clip, necklace or film to cover screen. I had no informtion to return it. Needless to say, I would NEVER purchase from this seller again.",247
1,"Add my review to the 1 star protest. The game might be great, but I can't support a title that treats legit buyers like pirates.It was a bad idea for Mass Effect, and it's a bad idea for Spore.",193
1,"I just want to add my voice to the chorus of those who are saying that this DVD player is TRASH!! I bought it so that I could play multi-region DVDs, and as many other customers have attested, it works for a few months, then stops working entirely. About 8 months later, all it does is play audio CDs...and it doesn't even do THAT terribly well (a slight scratch will skip audio CDs, and that is just plain unacceptable). You'd be better off throwing your money into a fireplace than buying this piece of crap.",510
1,"This novel, though well-written at times, has a major problem in its choice of characters, all of whom are pretentious expatriates who consider themselves SO superior to stupid Americans (that would be us, the readers). The story itself is ordinary and rather banal, distinguished only, and very occasionally, by the author's adroit use of language. Anyone looking for an actual story or characters outside a very small range of spoiled artistic types, however, should look elsewhere.",484
1,Was boring and couldn't even keep trying to read it. Not my taste of reading at all. I wouldn't recommend it!,109
1,This is just porn with a spiritual tag. The acting is laughable and the plot has nothing to do with the rapture. Even the $5.97 price was a waste of money.,155
1,"Product was fine, however, problem with the sizing itself. This product was undersized (i.e., and did not fit well) for how it was promoted by the saler. If you purchase this item, recommend that you buy at least one or two sizes larger.",237
1,They had a year to do this right. What happened?! When I got this it was a big let down. The reviewers who state that you should save your money and record this at home are absolutely right. The copy I recorded looks better than this one does. The extras (with no label at all) are unfinished scenes that are not worth buying. I guess they figured they could sell the fans anything. And they made us wait a year! For this?? Copies recorded at home are better looking!,467
1,"Bad acting bad editing, and only the most superficial points of the story were played out. The older BBC version was worthy though low budget.",142
1,"Kirkus summarized this book with ""a genial snooze"". How true! While I, too, enjoy reading about Martha's Vineyard, I expect the sleuth to do some searching for clues, which is at a minimum here. The solution is offered at the end almost as an aside to tending Joshua and worshipping Zee. Craig's earlier books are a bit better; I won't read any future ones.",357
1,Don't waste your money on this commercial rap garbage! buy still i rise by 2pac & the outlawz,93
1,"I also purchased a camera and was very pleased with the camera. However Amazon's web site suggested I should also purchase this camera case. When it was received, the case was too small for the camera. Due to the cost of returning the case vs the cost of the case I elected to toss the case. I feel there was misleading advertisement on Amazon's website",353
1,Only keeps coffee tepid at best. Actual element gets very hot; it just doesn't reach the coffee. Item is small enough to stay on the table. It makes an expensive coaster.,170
1,"...a too sweet Joan, an unconvincing Joan, a boring Joan. The flames were too long in coming.",93
1,"Within two months of purchase and very liitle use the Black & Decker BL600B blender started to emit a burning smell and smoke began to appear. It was unuseable at this point, I would not recommend it at all.",207
1,"This book is dry and unenjoyable and has zero practical advice. It is poorly written and basically is the same concept repeated over and over. I don't think it will help make the wait easier, after reading this, you will probably be more desperate than ever to find your ""someone."" For a really good book on singleness, I would recommend ""Sacred Singleness"" by Leslie Ludy.",373
1,"her first single just on the beat jacks Mary J.Bliege beats from 92-94&also Bites Lauren Hill Sound circa 1998.vocally she is alright.at the most she reminds me of a So-So Taylor Dayne. she ain't bad,but doesn't really move me that much either. the material I can take or leave on a whole.",289
1,"I thought the author couldn't do worse than his job with The List of 7--how wrong I was! The 6 Messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development. Characters and situations seemed trite and confusing and the last part of the novel was a complete waste. I still believe Frost has the potential for great exciting fiction, but somehow he fails to deliver.",385
1,"I bought this product based on amazon user reviews. Boy was I led astray. This product is worthless. One review said great for dust bunnies & toddler crackercrumbs. Let me assure you, this lethargic excuse for a broom vac will not do the job. Run time is short, power is positively anemic. Do not waste your money,electricity or time on this!!",343

1,"After the first wash of this bowl it's clear the interior isn't stainless steel. Seems more likely that it's just plain aluminum ... or the coating is either bad or nonexistent. It's now dull and almost chalky on the inside of the bowl, unlike my other stainless mixing bowls by another brand, always shiny and smooth. Won't be buying this brand again.",352
1,"I cannot believe that you are taking such advantage of parents- this toy is about $10 in most stores. I suppose if someone is dumb enough to spend this much- they deserve it, however.....",187
1,I returned the product because it was poorly made. I could not assemble it as the holes did notalign in the base so I could insert the bolts. The instructions said the base would be preassembledand it was not. Very disappointed in Dewalt as they normally they sell quality products.,282
1,"bought for gift, but would not stay tuned and strings broke 1st day it arrived. Would not buy this again.",105
1,"For anyone to say Wicca is that of Satan is totally wrong!!! I raise my chidren in the religion along with thousands and thousands of others, and believe me my children are far better then alot of their ""christian"" friends. Before Anyone writes a book on any subject they need to THINK I feel here he is Just Another single minded person, Preaching on something he trully knows nothing about!!! He is full of lies and Total Mis-Truths!!!",437
1,Why these conservatives are acting like cry babies?Shut Up and dance baby!,74
1,"This book is more concerned with praising vices and poo-pooing virtues than with actual history. For example ""...Princess Victoria grew up to be narrow-minded and self-opinionated. She was also a terrible prude... Prince Albert... was even more of a prude than she was. He once said that the thought of adultery made him feel physically sick."" The rest of the book sounds like it was written by a British tabloid as well. I thought I was going to see something enlightening by reading this book. I was quite wrong.",514
1,"The handle never can be tightened, it keep moving around, you have to screw it every time when you use it. the pressure lock sometimes not move up, you have to re-adjust it, so you have to be there to watch it. It is very inconvenience, unfortunately once you open the package, you can't return it. You have to take what you bought.But It can save a lot of time in cooking, you only needs about 45 mins for those food need to cook over 3-4 hours in a regular pan. The taste is better too.",488
1,"I bought this DVD because my daughter loves House of Mouse, only to find out after purchase that the DVD cannot be played in this region. Do not waste your money",161
1,"Only one other reviewer had it correct. This is no better nor worse than Brittany Spears or Avril Lavigne. If you like that trash, then you'll like this.On the other hand, I do suppose it's better than Bruce Springsteen or Bon Jovi.",232
1,I must respect Bobby Fischer as a player. But I learned some stuff that doesn't make me respect him as a person. I have read more things about Fischer which this book leaves out and should have been put in.,206
1,"I've had one of these for more than 6 months, to connect a Moto PEBL into our phone system.It works very poorly. Making outgoing calls is fine, but every once in a while when an call comes in we pick up using a handset but can hear nothing and neither can the caller.It cannot be used to charge the PEBL.Another problem is that it interferes badly with our 802.11b WiFi system (it effectlvely disables a wireless music streaming device in the same room). We've unplugged it; I wish I had returned it.",500
1,This is getting totally pitiful. The mini-series junk trying to span stories through all the different genres of StarTrek in my opinion belongs in the trash. Pocket Books is making a big mistake. I for one only care for the original cast books. I buy one to read (which I've read them all) and I get no ending unless I go read Next Generation and then the next genre and the next and the one after that.YUCK!!,409
1,this cologne smells like ass one really smells like bad BO. and the rest are just bad wouldnt recommend to anyone,113
1,"Robbins spends to much time rambling on in this one. The story is nice, if a bit overtly contrived to get his point(s) across, but he should have put it in a package about half the size.",186
1,Was looking for a muzzle which would gently keep my big puppy from trying to eat everything. It took approximately 30 seconds for the puppy to remove it when it wasput on properly. Would not recommend this to anyone. The seller was good and delivered product very quickly.,272
1,"This is NOT the original cut...this is the special fan cut, which is far inferior to the original. It needs to be marked as such.",129
1,This book was not especially helpful in our case as it caters especially to autism and if you have a child with another special needs diagnosis it will not be very helpful to you.,179
1,"Incubus Dreams was a long book and it felt even longer. I can barley remember the plot one hour after I finished it, but I wish I could forget the awful sex-scenes. But that I hated the plot and the sex is only a personal opinion. The worst about the book is the editing. There are typos on almost every page. That is simply unacceptable.",338
1,This book is a waste of good paper. I don't even know why anyone one would buy it!. If you want what's in this book go ask a five year old to write something for you. I know that will be much better than this mess,213
1,"I was REALLY REALLY thrilled when I learned that this movie was going to be released on DVD and placed order instantaneously. However, I was REALLY REALLY disappointed when I received it because the movie is split into 2 on a 2-side disc!!!This is clearly an insult to the customers. I wish Amazon could've indicated earlier, so that I could avoid buying it. I'd rather wait until they release a more decent version with the whole movie on 1 disc and the extras on another disc! Shame on you, Universal Studios, for doing this kind of ""unethical"" thing!",553

1,"I was looking for a great, affordable 5-button mouse. This one worked right off the bat--once I plugged it in. I was surprised that it came with a floppy disk with the drivers on it---who even USES floppys anymore!? I was able to dl drivers off the website though, so that wasn't a big deal. My biggest disappointment with this mouse is the fact that it is SOOOOO jumpy! It skips ALL over the place, and that is REALLY annoying. For this ONE reason, a very big one (to me), I rate it at a 2.",491
1,"I bought this to keep bottles in the baby's room (and hopefully avoid trips downstairs to the kitchen fridge in the middle of the night). It seems to do absolutely nothing. I understand that it is only intended to cool to 20 degrees below the room temperature, but when I plug this device in, all it does is make the quiet hum that you would expect from a mini-fridge, but doesn't cool anything or heat anything, or even keep cold things cool or warm things warm. This device was a complete failure.",499
1,I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!,266

1,"Oh, this book is SO full of it! If they had done ANY research AT ALL they would have found out that Shannen Doherty is a wonderful person, and if she got SO many people to HATE her character THAT much, then that proves what a GREAT actress she is! Her character had to be a mean, snobby person, and she was great at ACTING that part out, but in real actual life she is wonderful, and kind. These people need to get a life!",422

1,"I liked Joss Stone's first CD, but I can't even stand to listen to this one. It is so over done, it's obnoxious. The songs are just okay.

1,"Despite its title, this volume does not take us beyond ""The Godfather."" It indiscriminately mixes essays by writers who understand the Italian American experience (such as Richard Gambino) with those who only pretend to (such as Gay Talese) and those who actually despise their heritage (such as Marianna De Marco Torgovnick). As such, it does a poor job of countering negative stereotypes.",390

1,I really tried with an open mind to like this show. After 3 episodes I just couldn't take it anymore!

1,"I have listened to Pink Floyd probably once a week since 1974. It is in my will they will play DArk side of the Moon at my wake! I cry at times I am so overwhelmed with the music. This album makes me cry for a different reason. It has no life, its old, its boring, its repitious. I feel old having to listen to this. It has no heart, no juice. I literally cant listen to more than 1/2 a song before I change to another CD. The David Gilmour Live Concert DVD. I guess its his and Pink Floyds final hurrah!",504

The message (millionaires accumlate wealth by sending less) was so simple it could have been written on a postcard. This message was repeated endlessly. No actionable steps were given. The book is a complete waste of time. Now, I'm reconsidering my assessment of friends who have liked this book.",424

Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for something scary to happen. But no, right up until the end it remained boring as boring can be. People who like watching trees and some dead wood might like it. Don't expect a storyline or plot, there just isn't any. I watched it 3 times thinking I might'ave missed something. But no...it's just a 95 minute documentairy on dead wood.",549

The worst part is that even after all of that, the gum tasted terrible! I highly doubt that the manufacturer truely tested this process with parents and children.

At the risk of offending those who liked or even loved it, this was nothing but nonsense and a waste of time.",538

Alicia is great on this album but I did NOT buy it to hear her back-up singers sing over her and most of the songs. This album was a waste of my money.

Something there is missing, the now classic characters seemed bored and very boring. As with Generations I didn't care for the lighting which gives the Federation ship a very dark look. The film was promotted as the film with the vilian as good as Kahn, should be because he was a carbon copy. When are they going to just release a good story that doesn't have a vilian?",540

Complicating things are the bombastic '70s arrangements that only inspire Johnnie to push harder, in some cases with mediocre material like ""Tie A Yellow Ribbon"" (ick!). This will be a tough one for most contemporary listeners to slog through and will give a false impression of Ray's true talents to those not familiar with his best work.",520

The shaft broke within a year - the authorized repair center in Albuquerque wouldn't repair it as they said it looked like it had been abused. ... and I got another one. Same problems operating it. I'm going to go back to a 2 stroke engine. My previous 2 stroke Ryobi lasted about 6-7 years before the clutch broke - but there were no operating problems.",537

1,"There are many errors in this book. It is very thick but many pages are filled with useless analogies. It is badly written and does not cover many of the concepts in the PMPBOK. There are typing errors in there. The questions at the end of the chapters do not discus the more important concepts of the chapters, but rather are put there so that the author can advertise that there are more than 300 questions in the book. The main purpose for this book is to allow the author to advertise his bootcamp. This book was not very useful.",533
1,"Unfortunately, the option of zero stars was not available for this book. This is conservative reactivism at its worst. The author obviously misunderstood the purpose of a university education. The point of higher education is to open your eyes, not to further close them to the possibility of new ideas. Coming from the MECCA of campus ""liberalism,"" Berkeley, the leftist exterior is a faccade for latent conservatism.",418

When I complained, I was sent two more packages, so this was a better deal, but still not what I would expect from Amazon.

If they were caught beating an ADULT in this fashion they'd be arrested. But a helpless newborn? I'm sickened by anyone who goes along with these teachings.",481
1,I was fooled. Nowhere in the description of this product does it let you know that the story has been heavily edited from the original. I thought I was buying the unabridged story with the wonderful artwork! I bought this as a Christmas present over a year ago. Imagine my surprise when I was informed that my present was a heavily edited version of the story.,360
1,"Loved ""Gone, But Not Forgotten"" and ""Heartstone"", but this book was a major disappointment, especially considering how well it started out. The plot as well as several of the major characters were completely far-fetched, and I knew how it would end half way through the book. Sorry I wasted my time and money.",309
1,I just bought this thing and it is horrible. It barely toasts bread and leaves one burnt grill mark on the bread while the rest of it isn't even toasted. The worst part about it is that it makes the bread smell like aluminum and I believe it is unsanitary.,256

When my older sister was seventeen she did a lot more stuff and said more stuff that Hilary can't even define and probably has to ask her mom to help her. Why does everybody think she's so mature? If she was, she wouldn't let Lindsay Lohan and other ppl bother her. Instead, she wrote ""Haters"" which is such a baby name with baby lyrics because her whole family are babies!

Also, the papers are somewhat small. All in all, too expensive for what one gets. I am really disappointed. Maybe the customers who rated this paper 5 stars got theirs from a different production batch. I am taking away one star for the color, another for the size, and another for the price.",489

It appears to be just a bunch of recipes put together by a group of little wannabe Society girls looking for some attention. Too Bad.Carole MinorSt. Petersburg, FL",437

1,"I have an answer to the question now of what is the worst book I have ever read. This book takes the cake hands down. Take away the glossy pictures and you are left with a cold, frozen, solid turd hidden under a layer of snow. Coincidently, that is also its value...",266
1,"If you are hoping to see the original video then you are in for a major disappointment.The documentary was weak at best....other than some interviews with Bob Geldoff and Midge Ure, you only got to catch glimpses of SOME of the other performers. The video documented very briefly about Live Aid, USA For Africa, and Canada's effort with ""Tears Are Not Enough""....but once again, you didn't get to see the videos....only little glimpses here and there of the stars.This was truly a complete waste of money and my time to view it.",528

That could never happen to a real girl. My Scene dolls suck and Bratz rule.",445
1,"This game should have been a cheaper expansion, not a new 29.99 game. The game play is almost identicle to the first RCT. There is not much difference between RCT and RCT2 except for the Six Flags rollercoasters. The game was a real disappoinment for me.",254
1,The cook book was very disapointing. The only good thing about it was Andrew Weils tips that were scattered throughout the book. It should of been much better.,159
1,"Doesn't even remotely compare (IMVHO) to her ecstatic 1999 live offering, Electrica. The only saving grace is ""Para De Chorar,"" the very funky club-style bonus track. Even favorites that could've saved this set (like usually-amazing ""Ill Parole Negra"") come off weak. And Mercury's vocals here (again, save the studio track) sound overworked and, at times, (dare I say) half-assed. I am a longtime fan of Daniela and her band, but this one disappointed on first few listens. Who knows, though. Maybe it'll grow on me. (Stranger things have happened...)",552

1,This was the most incorrect biography I have ever seen. It is written by a historical fictionist and is totally trying to bring Washington down. This movie was obviously an opinion. How could the author say those things about Washington. I highly recommend you don't watch it. It should not be used for children. You'll be teaching your kids incorrect things.,359
1,"Like others have said, the pictures are beautiful, and the book is intriguing. The recipes sound great too. The problem is that they're really poorly written. He leaves steps out. Quantities don't always make sense. I was really disappointed. I won't buy one from him again.",274

One minute, they're both so happy and everything seems all worked out, and the next minute, redhead is screaming again and being pulled around by the ankles.I might just think so because I'm a kid with a short attenton span, but this movie is also BORING.",431

1,"I did not like the book. It did have some interesting points to consider, but it did not seem like discipline to me. I am more of a Love and Logic fan. I think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior (or don't care) until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them, which this book says not to do. I just don't agree with it.",387

No one who i play with would ever think of doing one of the devil-worshipping acts. We are all very normal too we have all played sports on a team and we are all very smart.

That's it. You'd be much better off saving your money and downloading experiments off the internet or reading ideas in a book. Waaaaaayyyy overpriced and not very much fun.

1,Looking for the first time at this cd you would think that it was Toby Keith singing all of his great songs but that is not it at all it is these Karaoke tunes of all his hits. Very Disapointing collection and the ad never told anybody anything How Rude!,254
1,"Brando is my favorite actor and he's known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job. He did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one. I am an admirer of ""off the edge"" movies and themes that are hard to take....However, this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought ""Bertolucci is a filthy, lecherous old man"". I rarely HATE a movie but this bankrupt, purely perverted film is just AWFUL. Hope Brando made a lot of money at least.",469
1,"I second all of the previous negative comments about this pitiful excuse for a sequel to HALO. I knew the game would never live up to all of the hype but never in my wildest dreams did I think it would suck this bad. Maybe the multiplayer makes some people happy but I loved the original HALO for the storyline and intense level play in the campaign. All of that is gone in HALO 2. Might as well have thrown $50 out of the window. Run from this game, run very far away...",471
1,"What I don't understand is how any individual (or in this case, individuals) can turn her nose up at seemingly every facet of American society to which they are unfamiliar with, and then attempt to pass themselves off as having any proper ettiquette whatsoever. aren't proper manners a means to set others at ease, rather than a means to place oneself above anyone who might, on a very hot day, condescend to wear shorts?I find this book (and its authors) to be childish and ridiculous.",486
1,it has decent cfm i would say about 75 to 90-cfm at about 25 to 28db but if you own a antec 900 or antec 1200 it is more like a light blue and dont match colors of the antec cases other then that it has decent air flow,218
1,Everything Fast had to say could have been done in about three chapters instead of eleven. Most of what he said could be figured out just by going through life everyday. There was really no significant information on nonverbal communication and what it actually means.,268

1,"It seemed like it would be a smashing album. But after a listen to it i felt i had been ripped off 17$. The mixing is slow dull and lets you fall asleep. Disc 2 is simply bad, the annoyingly sample filled carnival xiii hurts to listen too, With west on the 27th being the only highlight. This disc has parks in wilson is slow mellow form. Disc 1 is a little better. slightly faster. but still nothing impressive.",412
1,"I found this collar very difficult to juice up initially. When it finally did get properly loaded, I used it for several weeks, recharging it in between. Then it worked quite well and my dog was much better behaved. I did not need to use it for several months, then when I tried to juice it up again it would not hold the charge. Now it had died completely even though I have replaced the battery.",397

1,"I purchased this TV online. When I called to arrange for service I was given a total run around. Finally convinced them that TV was defective. Had to FAX receipt (which they lost second page). Never got a call back. Claim someone answered my phone and said there was no one living there by that name - never tried a second call to make sure they dialed correcty. Third call, I was told unit is not covered by warranty as it might be a refurbed unit.Manual is horrible - tech service is worse.Stay as far away from Polaroid as possible!",535
1,"This game is terribly pure and simple. First, the graphics are poor, the players looked distorted, with overally large heads and feet. Second, the game play and controls are poor, with the game handling nothing like real college basketball, and poor button placements. Finally, reality? They can't even get stadiums correct on the inside. They don't look anything like what they are supposed to be. Save your money, if you really want a good college basketball game, get ESPN College Hoops, you won't be dissappointed.",518

1,"The product title was deceiving. When I first selected it, it said ""Eau the Perfume"" (which is the product I have bought from amazon in several occasions). I was ordering so many things that I did not noticed that in the last page the title did not red ""Eau the Perfume"". (it did not specified anything). I received ""Eau de Cologne"", which is a cheaper product. I learned my lesson, I will be more thorough from in the future.",426
1,this book is a total snoozer! my class had to read it and it was the most painful thing i've ever done. the plot is so used and old! plus it was the most boring thing i've ever read. when we finished it i ripped it in half and threw it away. don't bore your brains out by reading this awful book.,296

1,"This hand blender does work effectively. The big problem is cleaning the mixing wand. The metal core of the wand is encased in a plastic sleeve. Whatever you are mixing finds its way inside the plastic sleeve. It is impossible to get inside the sleeve to clean it out. You can see the accumulated scum inside. It appears very unsanitary. I emailed Hamilton Beach about the problem. They never answered. The HB web site has replacement parts, but they don't offer pictures of replacement wands so you know whether they have resolved this design defect.",551
1,"Great features, very poor performance. This would be everything you want in a phone system, if only it worked. Very short range, many dropped calls, and a weird ""underwater"" sound on many calls, even less than 50 feet from the base station. Siemens really should offer full-value refunds. I can't imagine ever buying another Siemens product.",341
1,"Personally I thought this was a boring film with phoned-in performances by both Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts, and what little plot there was had no suspense or mystery or charm whatever and the entire project lacked the style usually found in Richard Curtis' work. Even a strong supporting cast that included Gina McKee was not much of a boost. I usually go for these sorts of movies but this is one Britcom (very little ""com"" to it, by the way) I didn't enjoy.",461
1,I have been interested in pole dancing for a number of years and have taken classes sporadically here and there. I really thought this video might be an instructional demonstration on the art of not only pole dancing but embracing sensuality and sexuality as well. What a waste of time. Poorly shot and not at all worth the price. I watched a part of it and threw it away.,372
1,"this is my 2nd purchase of a Kindle. I love mine so much i purchased one for my dauhter in law for Christmas and am thinking of getting one for my son too. It is so convenient, easy to carry around and easy to upload new book purchases. I took it on a 3 week cruise and it was so much nicer than carrying abunch of books. Thanks Amazon - this is the best electronic reader.",373
1,"I was disappointed that I purchased an Amazon Prime membership to use the free lending library only to discover that it does not include the Kindle ap for iPad. I just spent $79 for Amazon Prime and one of the benefits is not available for my device. I think this should be more plainly stated. I wonder what other ""benefits"" will not work because I do not own a Kindle.",370
1,If I wanted to spend my time repetitiviely learning complex acrobatic wall-jump-grab climb- manouvers I would just take gymnastics and learn the real stuff. This game is difficult with extremely complex controls. It looks great though if you like repetition and can advance the plot.,283
1,"My kids were watching this movie and I had to fast forward through it....wish I had read the reviews before letting them see it....they are too freaked out by the werewolf creatures and zombies to enjoy this movie. No comedic value whatsoever. This is a scooby movie for parents and maybe eight or nine year olds, NOT kindergarteners. Forget this movie, get the collections of the old episodes instead",401
1,"Very disappointing, at the end you'd say ""That's it"", there is no excitement or story at all.",93
1,Not a lot of traditional gospel songs--and the arrangements were too fast paced--like hyped-up blue grass musicians--poor song selection flow--lack of coherence--not recommended.,178
1,"My 14# puppy had the ball all of 3 minutes when some of the outside peeled off. I managed to grab a piece of rubber the size of a quarter just before Nick swallowed it. He either would've crapped a UFO or I'd have been spending the night in the delightfully expensive and chaotic animal hospital. I looked at the outside of the ball and grabbed the side of the green plastic-- it peeled off easy. I know I'm a wrong girl, but if this is ""Tuff"" enough for powerful chewers, then i should probably be trying out for MMA.I'll be adding a few pics of what peeled off.",563
1,This book makes absolutely no sense at all. Mostly rambling diatribe to fill pages and call it a novel. A waste of money.,121

1,"I am a big fan of Baldacci, and the plot of this book is awesome, however, too much information at the beginning makes this a slow read and easy to figure out the end halfway through the book.",192
1,I was very disappointed with this floating golf game. It was of poor quality and just about impossible to get the golf balls to go anywhere and it was impossible to hit or come anywhere near the green. I would NOT recommend this game at all.,241
1,"It does have its funny moments, but it's not laugh-out-loud funny like Little Britain (which I recommend).It's kind of boring.",126
1,"I received the game this morning (09-08-08) and have been unable complete the registration process. Game claims the registration servers are down.

1,"While the novel has its moments, it surely was not what gave Lawrence Block his big name. The plot is very ""on the surface"" and quick, possibly too quick. More could have been done with character development, and a more played out resolution could have been made. The detective Scudder could have had more dimensions to his personality, and more could have been added about the details of his ""relationship"" with his ex-wife and also more on how his hardened personality came to be. Hopefully, some of his later Scudder novels were written better.",547

1,"I also have seasons 1,2 and 3. Have been waiting (for years) for 4th season. Now the audacity to come out with a ""BOX SET"". Horse feathers, and a pox on their house. I for one will never buy what I already own. Boy, did you guys blow this one!!!",245
1,Cute looking but not very useful. My 9 month old daughter just rips it off the table and throws it on the floor.,112
1,"It's interesting to me that some of the best books have critics turn their noses up at them because they are truly inspiring and uplifting -- unlike Plainsong, where at the end of the book sad people are still sad, they've just realized that it's better to have a group of friends with whom to share your life. ""..exalt the reader"" it says on the cover. Not this one. Is it a new literary trend not to use quotation marks around spoken lines? Or for authors to repeatedly have characters say ""should of"" instead of ""should have""?",529

1,"Spear is a very good imitator (he paraphrases nearly an entire paragraph of Volume 2 of Needham!), but he's not very good at reading material.

1,I like touched by an Angel. But they should really let people know that it is only 4 episodes on the disc. And most of the episodes were older ones. And it was inspirational but If I would have known there were only going to 4 episodes I would have bought one of the earlier season DVD's for almost the same price and added 5 or 10 dollars.,340

1,"I purchased this calendar to help organize my family's activities. Although it is well made, it is very wide and requires a lot of space. I tried to hang it on a number of walls in my house as well as behind doors, but it is slightly to wide to fit behind my doors - the edges stick out and scrape the doors. If I trim it, the laminated cover will likely start peeling. While I like that it shows 3 months at a time, but have yet to use it because I haven't found the right place to put it.",490
1,"Nothing wrong with the item, alone... I'm sure it works as it should on a Moroso product. My beef is that it is shown by Amazon paired to the ""Accu-Gage 0-60"" and it is too big for the instrument's housing. Make sure you order the cover made by the manufacturer of the gage you wish to buy and don't take Amazon's recommendation.",329
1,"You get what you pay for with this product. I would get altered/discolored images and eventually the metal piece on the end, the piece that connects directly into your tv, fell out and rendered the cable useless.",212
1,"I made the mistake of not reading the reviews first. I purchased this cute camera in the hopes the 12MP would be remarkable. Problem is, the camera is only 5.1 MP, with a maximum of 12 MP! I took a few pictures using the tripod in excellent light and got the fuzziest, worst pictures ever. When I complained I was told this product is a camcorder, and only a digital camera secondary. What?! Why is it called a digital camera. Do yourself a favor and don't give this, whatever it is, a second thought.",501
1,"How much fallacious reasoning and misguiding statements can fit between two covers? We were hoping for advice based on science rather than superstition, and were sorely disappointed.

1,"Admittedly, it's the first time out for a whole-USA guide from those Australian backpackers, but this guide has a long way to go. Fine cultural information, but this book's write-ups are ambiguous at best, treating the best hostels in the USA the same as the very worst. True, these books are accurate, if by accurate one means ""not listing any hard information so that the hard information can never be wrong.""",411

If you have any graphic design skill whatsoever, you are already ahead of this book, even if you have never touched Flash.Buy Hillman Curtis' 'Flash Web Design' for inspiration about designing in Flash and the 'Flash 4 Bible' to figure out how to accomplish it. But don't waste your money on this one.",362

Both batteries exhibit the same behavior. Too cheap to even bother sending back. Go for a higher quality battery, I learned my lesson.",318
1,I tried reading this book. Quite a few times actually but I just couldn't get into it. I was very interested in hearing what Hanegraaff had to say because this is something that comes up in conversation at work a lot but his style of writing left me wanting more.

This book is a training manual for fundamentalist right wing Christians on how to apply literalist Bible teachings to bringing up young boys. It ignores years of scientific findings and common sense. If you are a fundamentalist Christian you'll find this book reinforcing to your already accepted beliefs, otherwise this is a deceptive and misinformed book.",491
1,"A wonderful ""Miss Read"" book is ruined by being riddled with page after page of typos in this slipshod Kindle version. How do you print ""die"" instead of ""the"" for three pages running? One of these Miss Read volumes even had (more comically), ""boob"" for ""book"" and ""fart"" for ""fact"". There are even typos that a basic spell check would have caught. Very sad indeed. On a brighter note, Amazon did take this back and refund my money.",431

This film had no emotional core, no compelling plot and nothing really mind-blowing or even mildly thought-provoking, at least nothing to compare to the freshness of the first two MIB flicks. I suspect many scenes looked awesome in 3D -- I saw it on a regular old DVD and thought it was pretty lame. (Axton)",479

The movies are boring and ugly, reminiscent of everything that the '70s pooped out, and should not be taken seriously.

A waste of paper and money.",361

It started as just one light and then progressed into three of the eight lights. The flickering is annoying, enough to make me take the device apart to see if there is a loose connection. There isn't. It is just a flaw in the circuit board. I wouldn't recommend buying this product.",415

The screws are such poor quality that I couldn't even remove one because it was so stripped which made it impossible for me to insert the batteries. All around a very cheaply made / looking item and not worth the $30 I spent on it even if it wasn't defective. Gladly returning it to get a decent product instead.,470

The R&B ballads and duet with Kelly Clarkson are the only things that make this album even worthy of music store shelves. The lyrics are mediocre and cheesy, and the vocal arrangement of the songs are sloppy and unprofessional. Not only is this album a critical failure, but it's failed to woe the so-called fans of Justin Guarini, considering it has been a commercial flop along with the co-released movie. Don't waste your time or your money.",523
1,"This book was a bitter disappointment. I made it through to see if it ever got any better. The characters were not ""normal"" in any way, and it was impossible to identify with any of them.

WHY, WHY, WHY do some moviemakers insist on ruining a perfectly good movie with arbitrary and manipulative melodrama?? I do not mind tragic or sad endings if they are poignant.

The problem with this unit is that it is just so cheaply built it's ridiculous. It could also be that it's powerful for it's own good, because the trigger valve is often the first thing to go.

The only thing worse is the asinine commentary by journalist Chris Welch, who has nothing to say, and says it for the mercifully short duration of this disc. It's just possible that he was attempting deadpan ironic satire in the manner of This Is Spinal Tap, but the balance of probabilities is against it. I have rated this as a single star because Amazon will not allow me to give it none at all.",518

It's too bad that this is about the best you can get in English. My advice if you want to read this story? Learn Chinese. Brewitt-Taylor has no clue.",449

His carrer is going down the drain after this and Alexander. Jennifer Garner is ok as Elecktra, I expected more from her. The only character I liked wasn't even in the movie only in the director's cut. Coolio is funny as the man on trial and has a funny line in it. Joe Pantoliano is also good as the reporter. But they can't save a bad movie that was bad enough already.",542

1,I found the optics on this range finder to be excellent but the rangefinder aspect was very poor for me. I never got an accurate reading on the golf course and sometimes it was off almost 100 yards. It may be that it was picking up other targets but that was not satisfactory for me. As a result I returned it.,310

1,I tried watching it about 3x - but kept falling asleep. I'm not sure if it was the production (audio and video) or the storyline. I would have really like to have watched again but with others. I was watching alone and they have been part of the problem.,254

1,"Yes, I noticed how this movie very subtly points out the monotony of so-called 'normal' lives. And usually, I appreciate any film that is willing to do this. Unfortunately, in this film, it all adds up to an excruciatingly monotonous story. If you like movies that drag on forever, scenes that linger on boring people for way too long........this is your movie..:-)I like Julianne Moore, but here, she is misused. I didn't care about her character. I didn't care about any of the characters. Everyone is just very dull.",519
1,"3rd rate Oi! put together by a dodgy group whose lead singer was ex member of a far right/racist hooligan firm (Chelsea) Yeh the songs dont have any openly racist lyrics but that doesnt change the fact that they are average at best.

The organizer is bolted to the wall in my garage.",316
1,I'm certainly not a BDW fan - but very disappointed at the Rich Mullins remake. Seldom does one improve on the original (as was the case here) so what is the point? Write your own songs and leave others alone.,209

1,"I was very disappointed upon receiving and listening to this CD. I had hoped for a CD that would provide high-quality Celtic music from Cornwall. Instead I got a CD with what sounds like an untrained children's chorus on most songs, and parts of the CD consist of talking, not singing. I do not recommend this CD to those who appreciate good Celtic music, which is widely available on the market today. Don't let your curiosity about the music of Cornwall cause you to spend money that could better be spent on a more traditional Celtic CD from Ireland or Scotland.",565

However, I caught a glimpse of the TTSG single, and I was totally disappointed at what I saw: three of the four songs (""Sleep Tight,"" ""You Take My Breath Away,"" and the intimate version of the song ""Time To Say Goodbye"") are all Sarah's recordings, even though she AND Andrea were featured on the front cover of the single together. For shame, Ms. Brightman, FOR SHAME!",555

1,"I bought 5 of these. Don't work too good in cold weather. Have a hard time starting. Flame in not very strong but rather weak. I bought it to light my BBQ. I was tired of the disposable ones.

1,"I purchased this book prior to my 3 year old son having his tonsils removed and tubes put in.While It's a great idea and concept -- the book was just too long.

1,"This ""book"" only really gives you 3 patterns and a few techniques. Is maybe worth $3.00 not $7.00.",98
1,How can anyone watch this? Surely only the most braindead people would want to see it. Too cruel to be funny and too cheap and trashy to be considered art. Maybe the audience for this is the same one for Jackass. Those people think a bottle rocket up the [...] is funny. I'm not a prude either but this is garbage. If you want to see a great Takashi Miike film - see Audition. That was a work of art and scary as hell.,418
1,"This movie is somewhat entertaining, but sporatic in it's storyline and pretty bland in the romance department. And what's all the hullabaloo about Daniel Craig's nude scene? There IS NONE. Even the sex scenes are totally G rated. Pretty dull.",243

1,"I loved Persepolis, so when I realized there was a Persepolis 2, I quickly bought a used copy from Amazon. When I received it, I was very disappointed to learn that I had already read it!

1,"I thought I loved it, but my first one stopped working after 2 uses and although Amazon was amazing at getting me a new one. My second one won't even start up. It acts like it wants to, but it never does. I would not recommend this product to anyone.",250
1,"One of the most annoying and phony films I have ever seen. How were the stories supposed to be related anyway? I just sat there, waiting for something, anything, interesting to happen. What a waste of time. The dialogue was so fake, and the characters were so flat, and what exactly am I supposed to love about New York in this movie? Nobody in real life speaks this way.",371
1,"My son is a huge fan of ""Hide and Seek Elmer"". I bought ""Elmer's Friends"" thinking he would love this as well. There is a lion in this book that has the most frightening face. My son would start to cry the page before in anticipation of the upcoming lion. I tore that page out of the book and now my child can enjoy this book again. The other animals are fun, but the lion is terrifying!",387
1,"My old razor died, and since I had good luck with Panasonic in the past I decided to get this one. Bad Idea. This unit has ZERO power. It does not make any discernable difference at ALL. I tried shaving dry, as I would with any electric. I tried shaving in the shower with lotion, as this is supposed to be a ""wet/dry"" unit. It was just the same as if I had done nothing.Back to disposables for now.BTW I would have given this zero stars but the system won't let me.",466
1,I have read many of Anne Perry's books and enjoyed all of them until I read this mess. The characters are boring and the story is also.

1,"Standing by itself this movie probably wouldn't have lasted a weekend in theaters before it got yanked. I saw it expecting more of the hilarity from previous movies, but was sadly disapointed. I sat there most of the time with baited breath just waiting for something funny to take off and it just didn't materialize. Don't get me wrong, there were some funny moments, but thats all there was. A Mighty Wind kinda blew!",419

Ultimately the frame ends up looked kinda battered & weird. Don't waste ur $ here.",366

1,"I bought two of these expecting the long lasting, strong, stiff type. I knew they were beads but these things are barely stress balls. They can pass for them but i doubt if there will be any hand strengthing going on or whether they will work for real stress relief. They are rather soft, the beads arent pack in tight at all and they feel more like a beanie baby than a stress balls. I returned mine but I still give it 2 stars because they may work for others. More like boredom or pass the time balls but not stress balls.",525
1,"This album would have made a classic two-sided single, with his absolutely sick and brilliant version of ""The 'In' Crowd"" (dig those power chords and freakout guitar solo) backed with the original ""Another Time, Another Place,"" which sounds like an outtake from ""Stranded"" or ""Country Life."" The rest of the album is at best OK--depends on how much you like the songs he's covering. It's pretty much a must-buy album for those two songs alone...try to find a used copy.",469
1,"These cards contain a fair amount of outdated information, especially in the internal medicine section. Some cover way too broad an area to really be useful in flashcard format; on the other hand, some cards are extremely brief. The lack of consistent format is also frustrating.

1,"I read this book immediately after reading Sams Publishing ""Teach Yourself Office '97 in 24 Hours"", which should be your first Office '97 read. The two dozen or so typos (you would think MS Press would be particular about this sort of thing) were pathetic enough without being coupled with a smattering of incorrect illustrations. This work is basically 'help files in print'. I haven't opened it since I finished it, which was a very happy day.",445
1,This has got to be the cheapest made stock I have ever seen I do not recommend it and am going to just throw it away!,117

1,"I bought one of these things a few years ago... and as many other reviews have noted... it does not heat air... it only makes it less cold. It is a complete waste of money. When I bought it, they advertised it as something you could heat your car with and defrost your windows with, but it is only good at one thing... barely moving cold air while heating it to just a few degrees warmer than it was originally.

1,"The author titled his book wrong. He should have called it, ""WWII in the Atlantic"" or ""U-Boat War"". 2/3 of this book is spent in the atlantic theater. The author gives the pacific theater about as much attention as you would find in a high school history book. Disappointing how the author can spend chapters on u-boat attacks on convoys and only gives a few small pages to battles like coral, midway...etc. The biggest Naval battle to date, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, gets next to no attention in this book. Save your money, pass on this book.",543
1,"This movie was horrible! A Grammy should NOT have been awarded for this movie... I have my theory on the Grammy that was given to both Halle and Denzel.. But I will say this, Denzel is a wonderful actor and did a great job in Training Day and should have been given a Grammy way BEFORE Training Day!!... The sex scene may have been a vital part of the movie but was not needed to that degree. The acting was horrible, and I am so glad I was able to sell my DVD back to the store!......",485
1,"Having just watched this dvd version (Apparently the only DVD availble) and I was very disappoinbted in the picture quality. In fact, it is the worst I have every encountered on a DVD opera. It appears that the theatre production people were unaware that a video recording requires a great deal more lighting than usual. Most of the scenes were so dark that it was almost impossible to make out who was singing unless you were aware of the voices.I have over 100 0pera DVDs in my collection and this one is by far, the worst one I have wasted my money on.",555

1,"Although I'll admit this CD has its charms, I firmly believe that it should not garner a five star rating. The detriments to this album include the following: first, the album is full of Lauryn Hill speaking inane lyrics that faintly resemble some sort of electronica instrument; second, the songs lack differentiation (as in they are mostly the same beat.); and finally, the bitter lyrics really give me a headache. (Disregard the rambling run-on sentances.)",459

Don't get this CD, get Cyndi Lauper's new one instead.",366
1,"The manufacturer wanted to make certain these pliers come together at the tip. Rather than build pliers to a high standard and design, they simply curved them outward so that they do not come together in the middle at all -- but they do touch at the tip. It goes to show that you can either (1) cry when you buy tools because of the high price, but then be glad every time you use the tool, or (2) be glad about the low price when you purchase a tool, but then cry every time you use it. I regret that I was glad to purchase these pliers at such a low price.",558

I used this poorly designed lock on my macbook pro and the thief was still able to destroy the lock with a cutter. Mind you, the lock portion was destroyed, not the cable. The thief was able to yank out enough of a crease located between my laptop hole and the combo lock itself for his metal cutter to easily break its clippers. Basically this device provides a false sense of security when contends to a thief with formidably-equipped metal cutter.",535

1,"this short book (63 pages), is hardly worth the time and effort of study. It builds a strawman position that supposedly is held by objectors of transubstantiation and then attempts to tear down those positions.

For those that wish to examine the Eucharist, I would suggest either books by William Webster or James R.White.",471

1,This book is not worth anyone's time. It is page after page of O'Nan retelling the depressing lives of several completely dysfunctional people.

1,I sometimes wonder what drug editors are on when they accept some novels. I'm afraid Monstrum is a perfect case of incomprehensible editorial decisions. Coincidence piles on coincidence as the hapless police inspector stumbles (litterally) on the solution to the crime. The ending leaves one totally exaspetated. One can only assume that the author's rush to justice was occasioned by his desire to reduce the reader's pain.,424

Having used this for about a week now, I wish I could return it, but it is too late. The lid is very hard to take off to fill. When reaching inside to clean it, the edge is not rolled so I am careful not to cut myself. It is not sharp, but it is not smooth either. The handle is awkward and the trigger to open the spout is not smooth, comfortable, or easy. Don't waste your money on this one.",513

Amazon was great and there was no problem returning it for a full refund with prepaid return shipping, but I will be looking for a better made strainer. This food strainer is not worth the price.",371
1,"I bought this thinking I could use it to teach my granddaughter how to play guitar. It's a toy only, incapable of being tuned. I affixed it to the wall in my recording studio and it suits that purpose nicely. Then I bought a playable guitar at, of course, a much higher cost.",275

The quality was markedly lower and the pan diameter was actually less than 10 inches and the height of the pan is nearly 1/2 inch lower allowing spills more easily. You can find better pans at similar prices.",321
1,"I bought this book because I am studying Stoicism and wanted to read some modern works. Unfortunately, all I learned from it was the author's philosophical views. It was apparent from the beginning that his understanding of Stoicism is superficial at best. If you really want to learn the Stoic art of living read something written by a Stoic, either ancient or modern.",369
1,The book is much better. The movie *could* have been amazing but I don't think Julia Roberts owned the character very well. Also the cheesy melodramatic music cheapened it a bit. The book was awesome though!,207

1,"The show got stuck in a rut throughout most of the second season. Most of the episodes seemed pretty contrived, and the storylines start to get predictable. The bright spots of course are anything involving Richard Belzer and Ice T - perhaps the biggest problem with this set is their lack of screen time.",305
1,This movie is one of the worst ones I have ever watched. The only reason I watched it the whole way through was because my mom bought it for me at my request and I would have felt guilty if I hadn't. This movie had the worst effects I have ever seen - even a 1920's movie would be better than this! The plot - horrible/stupid/idiotic! The acting itself was much to be desired. To sum up - don't waste your money - buy a real movie instead!,439

1,"The only reason they got the second star from me is because of their first album. Their first album ""Youth and Youngmanhood"" was absolutly astonishing. The re-birth of southern rock even.

1,"The music on this CD is predictable, good old standard stuff. Exactly what I thought I was paying for. What I didn't know I was paying for was the lengthy advertisement at the tail end of this CD.

Unless you like ads blaring on your stereo rather than music, you'll pick another recording.",420
1,"The minute I plugged this in there was this awful buzzing from the clippers. I figured that the blades were just needing to be adjusted so I oiled them, but still, this very loud buzzing.

1,The image presented for the .3 is deceptive. The .3 does not come in a silnylon pouch as depicted in the image. I believe the pouch is a good part of the value of the product as it is bright yellow and is highly visible when in the pack and finding it quickly is of utmost urgency. Since the virtual shopping experience does not allow for hands on inspection of the product the images are critical that they are accurate and depict the product being purchased.,460

When taking a shower it felt like i was getting sprayed with a power wash gun like what you wash with a car, so the water gets sprayed everywhere.

The design itself was ok, but the table spoons (or dinner spoons I suppose according to the box) were extremely large and heavy. The spoon might not fit in a small person's mouth. It's almost as large as the included serving spoon. The large forks and knives were very heavy too because the handles are very thick and round. Tone your muscles while eating your soup!",538

However after this the storyline became increasingly weak and muddled. Gemini was the worst of all.

As long as the arms race was waged on a purely quantitative basis, the Soviets could hang in the game. Once the equation became both Quality AND quantity, the game was soon over. Gorbachev (among others) knew this; hence, his zeal to persuade Reagan to drop SDI at the Iceland summit.",465

1,"Not to bore either publisher and prospective customers with a lengthy anecdote, I am going to simply say it: this encyclopedia sucks on the Kindle. I purchased the book as a means to explore the many facets of the occult, but the inability to jump between letters (A, B, C, D, E...) or even click on links to connecting topics mars the usefulness of the book. I implore the publisher or Amazon to reconstruct the e-book so that it is both useful and portable.",459

Lunasa is one of the driving forces in modern Celtic music IMHO, so I was all ready to rush out and get copy from Amazon. However, the band also mentions (on their site, http://www.lunasa.ie) that they have split from Green Linnet, and that the version of albulm from them is not as they wanted. They offer an ""artist approved"" version for sale from their web site. I suggest you get that instead, at least till Amazon stocks it.",508

1,I purchased these with the double lane slip & slide for my grandson's birthday. The kids had a blast with them but they aren't very durable. One only lasted for a day and the other 3 for about 3 days worth of use. I guess quality isn't an option anymore.,254

1,This book spends the bulk of its content addressing basic and well documented java and web application concepts rather than the SAP JCo. The book also spent way too much time on the treatment of open source internet technologies.There is more sample code and documentation provided for plain old Java programming than for SAP specific Java issues and concepts. The samples that are there are also overly simplistic.,415

1,"This book is a fine example of beautifully written, highly descriptive prose. Unfortunately, it serves only to demonstrate the overall importance of story over style. One keeps waiting for the story line to pick up, and occasionally some vague hint promises that it might. It never does, then one begins to hope that the ending might justify all the labor invested in the bland reading. The end resolves nothing; it is neither unique nor even interesting, leaving the reader wondering how he or she got duped into staying with such a long, lifeless narrative.",559

1,"""When the Legends Die"" is one of those books that seem to just drag on forever. There are so many minute details about everything, that by the time the author gets to his point (which he rarely does) the reader could care less about what the author has to say.

Most of them happened throughout the state and happened over a very long time period of over 50 years. This kind of schlock gives communities unwarranted reputations.

1,"After 2+ years since the last, I was practically salivating for this book to come out. Like many fans of W.O.T., I reread the whole series to prep for the release of ""C.o.T."" And what we've ended up with is a book, the contents of which could have been summarized in a forward. There is virtually no movement in any of the storylines. There are far too many pages describing the outfits that everyone is wearing. The first 2/3 of the book takes place at the same time as the last 1/3 of the last book. Mr. Jordan, some resolution please.",537

1,"The basket didn't fit the walker. It looked used. It didn't come with instructions, yet there were some loose pieces that we couldn't figure out what to do with. It didn't securely clip onto the walker and would fall off easily.I called the manufacturer to return it, and the person on the phone said they would issue a call tag to pick it up free of charge. We waited three weeks, it never happened. We finally sent it back ourselves and the shipping cost more than the product.My advice: Buy one in person so you can examine it and make sure it fits your walker.",564

1,"I purchased this CD because it kept getting 5 star recommendations. I am VERY disappointed by the sound of it. The musicians are excellent, yet they have mixed themselves to death. The result is a beautiful voice lost in a sea of predictable, new-agey reverb. Most of the tracks sound the same. As a radio/sound editor by profession, this style is nails on a chalkboard for my ears. I'm turning around and selling mine right away.",430

It was bent so bad that it took serval days to get back in shape plus the the fray on the end was all but ripped nearly off.

Last November we had to replace the bridge with a different brand because the local store only had a 4/4 Glaesal bridge and she had a school concert coming up. The Mute fits just fine, but we tired and tried and could not get the the mute to work. At best there was about a 5% reduction in volume. I doubt the fact that the replacement bridge being a different brand made any difference.",471

Panasonic would not stand by their product and I was unable to get the camera fixed without a substantial fee. After four calls I was unsatisfied and the camera still cannot zoom. At a store I found that the zoom lever easily comes off. Avoid this product. There are too many cheap factors that can ruin the great features. Technical and customer support are useless.",499

1,This book just reinforced what I was already doing. The only thing that really sparked my interest was to include my child in more of the household activities even though he is young.

Both the shipping box and the product box inside were completly smashed with very little packing material.

I am not going to say that Norah Jones is a bad singer, she is better than many prefabricated pop singers, but in no way is she better than contemporary vocal jazz singers like Holly Cole. If you want something new from the regular classics like Fitzgerald or Vaughan you are way better off buying a Holly Cole album. You won't regret it.",520

Franklyn is not a super hero or a comic book villian. I guess it is not my kind of movie.",383

It is not very fun for children with little imagination, as the dolls can get boring and end up either with their heads pulled off, in the ""Barbie Pile"", or fed to the bulldog. As Barbie Dolls go, they can get boring after awhile and are not educational.(...)",475

She's an alcoholic whose actions while drunk are supposed to be cute/funny -- browbeating the bartender who won't serve her anymore, fumbling around trying to make phone calls, staggering. Not to mention planning to drive while completely intoxicated. Who finds that sort of stuff humorous anymore?I enjoyed the small town atmosphere.",441
1,"We have had one of these in the family since 2009, and finally gave in to requests for another. The one that was sent was not like the photo.

1,"I LOVE Creed so don't get me wrong here but... this book is horrible, 1) and foremost it isn't endorsed by Creed 2) the book is not written well, and 3) you can't figure out what is true or false. I didn't like the way that Creed was compared with bands such as Pearl Jam and the Doors. The fact of the matter is if you like Creed, watch VH1's Behind the Music: Creed, it's much easier to understand, and you know that Creed agreed with it.",440

1,I grew up in that 70's era of the blaxploitation movies and that did not scratch the surface for me. Sure the clothes the hairstyles and the sets was a good description but the great blaxploitation heroes and heroines fought for serious issues that was going on in the black community and I am very sure it had nothing to do with a presidential conspiracy to shrink the black males genitals either.,398

Now when I plug the USB cable in only the blue light appears.

I guess I should have just taken it off and returned it but you all know what a pain that is. I'll have to chalk it up to experience.Bottom line: Don't believe everything you read.

1,"As a fan of Linda Howard, I was greatly disappointed in her hardcover debut. The characters & mystery could have been developed more. This is almost more of a short story rather than a full length novel. The story doesn't really even develop. Save your money for the paperback or borrow someone else's copy of the novel. Linda really needs to return to the style of writing she exhibited in ""Dream Man"".",403
1,"This would have been a very good DVD release if not for the incredibly annoying, hip-hop tinged intonation of ""Oh My God"" in between every single segment!

If Terri Gore's dad wasn't famous, she couldn't get the time of day from a record producer with this nasally, whiny sound. Her cover of ""Midnight At The Oasis"" should be a criminal offense. Save your money, and your ears, and buy the original. It may be 25 years old, but at least the scratches on a 45 would spare you the nasal twang of this CD. [...]",445
1,"Me and my husband had received this as a house wwarming gift and were in love with it...at first. It looked great at first, and took up considerably less space than a microwave. However the timer stopped working after only about 5 or 6 months. So, we would just set another timer, and then turn it off. But the thing up and died all together after about a year and a half. It was also very difficult to clean, even the exterior got to looking very bad. I would never buy this again.",482

1,"This product was not worth the money. I could have purchased a better piece of medical equipment in a toy store. It was very light weight and did not give accurate readings, when it gave a reading.

I eventually got frustrated with the device and returned it.",396

I really love the blue/black color, and the pens do write beautifully. However, I was hoping that, for the price, they'd last longer. I bought a pack of four pens, and each one has lasted me less than 2 weeks before running dry, roughly 30 or 40 pages of writing, using the front side of the paper only because the ink tends to bleed through a little.

1,Ms. McEntire sure likes her music loud and overpowering. More is not better and this CD could use some toning down because some of the songs are actually pretty good. Its the overproduction that kills it. That's why I'm only giving it one star. Listen to the first track if you don't believe me. You'll need to take some Excedrin Migraine after it.,348
1,"Come on, they could have done so much better than this. I was looking forward to the best songs, not the worst. The last one by Mig was good and that was it. I thought the show was ridiculous anyway because the voters clearly liked Mig and Marty better, yet J.D. the baby won. Thats ok, he can go down the toilet with an outdated band and the others can launch real careers.",374
1,"Horrible movie! Every other word is a swear word. No reasonable story line. Don't waste your money. I stopped the movie after 1 hour, and I refuse to watch anymore. I NEVER do that! If there was a way to give it zero stars I would. I think even a single star is too generous.",275

1,"Ok, here is a simple test. If this book contains nothing but the truth, then why didn't the author provide support of his claims? Where is his documentation? Please tell everyone where we can go check out the truth ourself. Just because one man is shouting something doesn't make it the truth. No one can prove any of this. No one can provide other sources outside the system that back up any of what the author says. And just because he ""says so"" is *not* good enough.",469

The DVD quality is okay, put the plot and action are not good. There is only a couple of 5 second sword fighting scenes in this movie. A woman is forced to marry her fathers enemy. She eventually grows to love him, but he gets killed. She falls in love again, but finds out this guy was sent to kill her. She has no fight scenes. The couple of sword fighting scenes in the movie arent worth talking about.",548

1,"This seemed easy enough to put together until I found that two of the holes that were supposed to be predrilled for the dowels weren't. There was no phone number or email on the instructions. In order to get a piece that was properly drilled, I had to fill out a form, mail it and wait 2-4 weeks for a replacement piece. I had to have someone come and drill the holes. If you don't have someone that is handy, do not buy this product. It's really too bad since it would've been perfect otherwise.",496
1,"However, for me the jury is still out if PhotoReading works or not. I bought the home study tapes and I have been encouraged somewhat, although not nearly to the same extent as the other reviewers here. A salesperson at Learning Strategies told me ""that practically no one"" learns to PhotoRead from the book alone. Buy the book only to get an idea of what PhotoReading is about, and then be prepared to spend $250 for the home study course if you want to explore it further. In my opinion even if half of what they claim is true, it's worth the investment.",556
1,"Simply put, for 30 dollars more you can get something that will actually make carving enjoyable. I received this as a gift, am happy to have something to carve with, but am already in the market for another carving set. It's too light weight, flexible. The knife does keep its edge nicely.",289

Besides the fact the lyrics were written by a 3-year-old on Meth, the music is just a cheap rip-off of various R&B, Rap, and Alternative artists. One of the songs could easily be sung by Michael Jackson, which is not good. Folks, do not buy this - it plain ol' sucks!",386
1,"The accompaniment is great... the arrangements are lush and interesting. But Scofield just solos along with no melodic intent. He seems to be filling space with meaningless improvisation.

Like as soon as she heard a rider that showed alot was coming to Pine Hollow she immeadiatley went nuts, that's not at all normal.

1,First of all the pump did not work. I called the help number and they walked me through a repair. I had to take the machine apart and re-attach the wire for the pump. After fixing it I made my first espresso but it came out luke warm. I have a Capresso Ultima at work which does a great job. I sent the Chamonix back and bought a second Capresso,345

1,"After carefully reading all the reviews, we decided to go ahead and order this frig using the 1-day shipping option. We thought that certainly Amazon had fixed the problem.

1,"I realized what sad shape our country is in when I read this ""bestseller"". The reading level is approximately 5th grade, and that's pushing it.

1,"This film is a complete failure on every level. I enjoyed the first film, and bought this dvd based on that. This is like something shot in your backyard with your buddies over the weekend. The humor reminded me of the VAMPIRES SUCK trailors that have been assaulting televison lately. The entire thing is painful to watch. I was ashamed of myself when I made it to the credits.",378
1,"After the first 15 minutes I knew that the best part of the movie had past, but I kept watching because I paid for it... I should have stopped. I Shot Andy Warhol keeps getting worse as it goes on. Lili Taylor is a bore to watch and none of the other characters are able to save the movie. This movie was just all around bad and a drag to watch. Pick another independant film if you're looking for something interesting.",420

1,I am a big monkees fan but this is the worst video I have ever seen of them because it doesn't make any sense. They should have burned the film after they only shown it on tv once and I would not buy or watch it again. Not worth the money or time,246

1,"Rent this movie before you buy it. The first two thirds I found pretty boring, with some more exciting sections in between.

Beware, severe camera-shake can cause motion sickness.",326

The disk is hard to remove because of the small space provided for your finger to fit into to remove it . The door you have to open to load the disk is way to big. Picture quality is good . Sound is fair . I use this product only once and a blue . But I'm sure someone who may use it often would have a problem with the single hinge in the middle . Unless you left it mounted in your car ...",496

After I unplugged the ScoopFree for a few days, I didn't have to deal with wiping and cleaning my carpets anymore.For my cat, ScoopFree was a horrible purchase.",467
1,"Sorry, but I listened to ""Vita Mia"" and was horrified at the way the tenor was hanging just underneath the pitch, trying to encompass it with his very wide vibrato.

1,"I was very disappointed. This was a father's day gift from my chldren to their dad. The battery would not stay charged, and when connected in the airplane, the on/off switch in the plane only worked once or twice. The remote control handle did not work either. My husband was not even able to get the plane to fly at all. This product is very poorly made from the plane down to the remote control. I would not recommend this product to anyone. As a matter of fact, I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this particular airplane.",537

1,"The book tended towards rants against organized religion, and the author's persistent use of emotionally charged verbiage revealed quite a negative bias. It is unfortunate as there are a plethora of examples the author could have used to make his points, which in a few cases were worthy of note. Overall not worth the effort or the price.",339
1,"I have many years of diaper changing experience under my belt and have used many brands of wipes. I wanted to like these wipes, but they fell short of my expectations and smelled strange to boot. They are small, insufficiently moist, have poor cleaning ability, and a bizarre chemical-sweet smell to them (they are marketed as unscented!) We were happy to get through the seemingly endless supply and were pleased to be reunited with our tried-and-true Kirkland wipes, which are the best bang for the buck in my opinion.",520
1,"Like the other reviewers, this movie was on our Benji DVD. So, I thought nothing of putting it on for my 5 year old. Big mistake. She's still crying as I write this and after watching the first ten minutes to see what the deal is, I turned it off (racial epithets, drugs, probation and prison all in that short time). Note to self and others, just because it comes with Benji don't assume it is OK for children.",411

Madonna please stick to music. It's what you were meant to do so do it instead.",379

1,"Kirstie Alley Weighs herself......then spends the next 5 min screaming and moaning on the bathroom floor. That beginning says it all about this series, unrealistic, way over the top, irritating but not very funny aside from a few scenes with former ""Blossum"" Myam Bialik. I like Kirstie Alley's no B.S. attitude and I like the premise of this series, I just think she very much over did it. Audiences fled it in droves after it's well rated premier.

However, wording is unclear, some examples are incomplete or suffer from clarity, and some problems and examples don't explaing how intermediate values used are actually determined.

1,"Don't buy this!!1. Uneven illumination - it's most noticeable at boot-up time when the entire screen is grey -- the corners are a different shade from the center of the screen.2. It has a ""focus"" option. But no matter how you adjust it, you can't get everything sharp. If the left of the screen is sharp, then the right is smeared and vice-versa. This is especially noticeable with text.3. External power supply. This is common, but not necessary, in my opinion. It's lazy design, I think. I'm going to send it back,",516
1,"Somehow not what i expected it to be yet at the same time exactly what I expected, if that at all makes since. Reading it became very tiresome.

1,"This production is not for everyone, especially fans of traditional ballet and Tchaikovsky. While the overall production is of a very high caliber, I found occasional vocal interruptions by the cast during the performance (yowls of ""hurrah!"" for instance) to be especially disturbing. Do not purchase this video unless you are familiar with the contents. Definitely not appropriate for children!",395
1,"I love the idea and purpose of this book, however the flaps to lift to peek at the bugs are made of flimsy paper. My son tore this immediately. He loves books that he can manipulate and feel and I thought this book would be great for him. Even though he understands to be gentle there was no way the flaps in the book were going to make it. Eventually he tore too many to be able to use.",387

All a matter of taste, I'm sure -- so before you buy, do try to read any posted pages this book may have available.",378
1,Such a letdown after Girl in Hyacinth Blue. This book has none of Girl's poetry or soul. For a better written depiction of Artemisia try Alexandra Lapierre. And no characterization of Galileo can top Sobel. It seems as if Vreeland was writing to make a deadline or fulfill a contract for that critical second book. It's not written from the heart.,347

The sticks are so hard to bite into and then chew, my jaw ends up getting sore after only one piece; definitely not good. 2. Way too salty! The flavor of the beef is masked by an undeniable taste of too much salt.I think I only eat 1-2 pieces a week, simply when I need a quick protein source; I wouldn't recommend these to people, especially if they are looking to a tasty and fun to eat snack.",550
1,"This book will be of interest only to people who desire information on President Lincoln's reputation just before and during his terms in office. It is not a general history of the man or the era. Professor Trefousse's aim is to give a multitude of specific quotes from the time extolling President Lincoln to rebut the supposed thought he was almost universally disparaged before his assasination lifted him to martyrdom. To me, it is a book on which most avid readers about Abraham Lincoln can afford to give a pass.",518

1,I ordered for my nephew who is under two thinking he could put toys in it and pull them around in the wagon. But when I got the wagon I realized it is a item that would work for a basket or to decorate the yard if there were no neighbor kids around. It is not a toy. I am dissappointed as I was looking at the Radio flyer name since my son had a radio flyer when he was a kid maybe it would be a fun toy. It is not a toy even though it comes up under that heading. It belongs in home and garden. I am returning this one to Amazon.,530

1,I am a bit baffled that this film is labeled an adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's masterpiece. The only things it shares with the novel are characters' names and the time period. This film single-handedly dismantles an American classic. Classics should NOT be tampered with. This is a laughable attempt at making a film from this timeless novel.

In the period mentioned in the book, practically everybody was killing everybody else in a country torn by ethnic strife fueled by imperialist foreigners. Innocent ethnic Greeks were killed, yes, but keep in mind that lots of innocent Turks also perished. Calling this kind of nightmare a ""genocide"" is just an inappropriate use of the word.",478
1,"I just started reading this, and it is a good story so far. However, the Kindle formatting is atrocious and that is what this rating is about. No quote marks around dialogue? Seriously?

Hopefully as I read it the formatting will improve, but I looked ahead a bit and it does not look promising.",399

1,"The mystery of deep throat has been a persistent part of American political mythos for thirty years. That is exactly how long Bob Woodward held onto the secret of who helped guide him towards the downfall of the Nixon administration. Personally I was never swept up in this mystery so the who's who just didn't matter. What came across as meaningful was the concept of journalistic standards, an idea that has ceased to exist in recent years. Bob Woodward set the standard for keeping the identity of a deep cover informant but no one has lived up to it since.",560

1,"Those who scoop kitty litter know what happens when the slots are too big - much of what needs to be removed falls right back into the kitty litter. The overall size of the scoop is very small. It might work with clumping kitty litter, but I don't know because I don't use clumping kitty litter. The only good thing I can state about this scoop is that the plastic is recyclable, so it didn't end up in a landfill when I threw it out. Waste of money.",450

They love the songs from the movie (I think there are 2) and they love the one from the Wizard of Oz - but there is a bunch of Bugs Bunny stuff and other various junk on there that isn't very entertaining at all. Some of the footage is really old with dubbed over songs to try to make it fit the theme of this video. It's collecting dust - not worthy of purchase,530

No gold filter included. I have bought other electronic equipment in the past that was referb and most arrived in excellent condition. I would say that the referb company has no QC controls before sending units back into the field. Bottom line watch for discounts and purchase new. (may try as a boat anchor),491
1,The writers style needs refining. It reminded me of a cross between The Outermost House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This is not a combination that works.

1,"I thought this was one of the worst books ever written. It has so much historical distortions that fit neatly into a radical feministic viewpoint of the biblical times. This book demonizes males of the biblical times. Furthermore, it takes the central character and tries to make us believe that a girl who is barely into puberty can have a deep romantic sexual experience and fall deeply in love with an adolescent male after just meeting him. The entire book is contrived. Furthermore, it is an insult and affront to the Old Testament.",537

1,"This kettle has been a major disappointment. Purchased to replace an older Krups kettle that gave years of great service before expiring, this model lasted just nine months before failing. Krups provided a replacement at no charge - a process that took three weeks - and the replacement kettle has failed after four months. The weak part of this model seems to be the on-off switch in the handle.In my opinion, the name Krups no longer stands for quality, dependability, and longevity. This particular model of kettle is a cheap Chinese clunker - avoid it.",556

Little to no guitar, sax and keyboard solos and intricate melodies. Stanton must have been bored drumming the same hip hop beat through the whole cd.

1,"The most amusing part of this movie is how they parody the real division in our political system, but once you get beyond that the movie comes across as kind of stupid with a few amusing parts thrown in here and there. I like Will Ferrell, but he does basically the same thing in almost every movie and its become old news. They had the potential to do so much more with this, but it ended up being a mediocre movie that you might rent and watch on a night when you don't really have anything else to do.",504

1,"While the effort is there, this CD isn't anything we haven't heard before from a 1,000 other singer/songwriters. This CD drifts into too many directions for me. Condron should back off from trying to convince the listener that he is a great vocalist, to using just enough emotions in his vocals to sell his stories he sings about. A good producer could help maybe find that nich. I would be willing to hear more, but only if this artist seeks a direct focal point for his music When Condron can find a true path direction he may go places.",539

I would rather reach the conculsion that Tyber is pirate-like by seeing him in action, than having it pointed out to me every couple pages. This book was very sensual, a plus, however the sensuality was the main focus of the book and the story line/mystery was a distant second. If that is what you are looking for, you will probably enjoy this book.",504

The photos are extensive, and a few have not been seen before by non-historians like myself. Otherwise, there was almost nothing new to be learned about this very remarkable and intelligent woman, much to my disappointment! Most amazing was that her grandson actually admitted that he was ignorant of her role on the public stage until her death when he was 20 years old!",489
1,"First there'e the misleading title - COMPLETE CONCEPTS & TECHNIQUESOnce I went through this book, I found it very easy & thought I was really a PRO in VB6.I got a rude shock when I actually met my programming friends: If you think you are a pro and can create useful applications with this book, you cannot be more WRONG. This book teaches you nothing about VB6 language. All it does is teaching you to layout a nice form & some extremely elementary code.I personally do not think you can create anything useful based on the knowledge from this book.",550

1,"When i brought this album, i was think i would like it as it was mel c & as a fan.I it was very poor, non of the songs i really liked apart from On The Horizon.Dont buy this album if you want the same as the first album. cause it is no way anything like it.",257
1,"All the gimmicks in the world couldn't match the brilliance of ""WHO'S NEXT"" by the Who. This album tries to be clever and fails. It lacks that edge and drive to compare to a truly great rock album like the aforementioned. And when people I know have compared the two, they have come to a similar conclusion.",307
1,"I expected to be able to use these as oven mitts indoors as well as outdoors to replace the welders gloves I usually use. These are lighter and may be good for outside use but I have already found out the hard way (ouch), they are to light for use as a pot holder.",264
1,"The bottle works fine, once you are able to screw on the not terribly smooth screw top. The only real problem is that the closure is a small plastic tip. I could imagine it falling and disappearing forever. Other bottles of this sort have a closure connect to the bottle itself.",278
1,Terrible product. Everything sticks to it. Doesn't matter how low or high the heat is. There is nothing non-stick about it.,123

1,This book is helpful to the person who is taking a Linguistics Course as part of a core curriculum. The book is fairly easy to comprehend and presents a decent survey of the important issues in Linguistics studies.,214
1,"I love the content of the discs but I wonder why this bluray ''collector's edition'' did not includes the booklet of the dvd? it's annoying!!!. I hate the edition , it's too simple.",181
1,"These cases are super brittle, I bought one recently from this seller, and in the past on ebay. In both instances the cases have been tough fits. The cases are SUPER brittle and will more than likely crack on you while screwing them on (like mine did). I am pretty upset at the cost of them for how cheap they are. I now have a nice transparent case with a huge crack down the middle and a DVD drive that wont open. .... not worth it",433
1,"I bought an Audivox dvd player and it was defective out of the box. I sent my device back to Audiovox FOUR times for repair, was charged $90 for 'repairs', and it still doesn't work properly!!! The customer service was extremely rude each time I called and never returned my messages. I would burn my money rather than buy another audiovox product!",348
1,"I was really excited when i read the reviews. I always thought that these dancy type workouts never really gave you a workout. But i decided to purchase this DVD anyways since everyone gave such good marks. Unfortunately my original instinct was right. The difficult steps didn't really bother me because i was able to pick them up after a couple of times, but i just didn't feel like i got this great workout when i was done. I didn't really sweat or get my heart rate up much. It's too bad, because i really like Allison and her DVD's.",537

Streets in the city are not on the map. I got home and checked maps.google and sure enough, Streetwise just has it wrong. Maybe other parts of the city are better but I had a similar experience in Diamond Heights only I blamed myself. Now I'm wondering if it was the map.",450
1,"I bought this ages ago from a catalog as it was described as ""hilarious"" and a romp through what we don't realize we're revealing. I finally picked it up tonight and feel the fool for having wasted my money. I found it neither funny nor a romp. I did, however, find it over-simplified, pretentious, and judgmental. Is that direct enough, Madame Author?",352
1,"This is actually an old album produced before Foundation. Everything that was right with Foundation (their best album IMO) is wrong with Time's Running Out. Tired lyrics, tired delivery, tired CD. This should not be the CD that Brand Nubian goes out on...",255

1,"If you like the way the frame looks in the picture you will be sadly disappointed when it arrives. The picture they shows that there is not matte around the screen. when you receive yours it is large, bulky, has a 3/4 inch matte around the frame that looks cheap, plus the frame appears to be put together buy someone with poor craftsmanship. I purchased one of these frames [...] and they screwed me over on the deal. I just want everyone to be aware that your item will not look like this picture.",499

2,"What I seen through this movie was a Tale of Faith, Hope, Love, Courage, Strength, Truth, Justice, Compassion. The depth of this movie was amazing. I seen the application of many Biblical Principals throughout this entire movie. Light vs. Dark. Characters dealing with trials and wanting to make things right. I thought it was a wonderful movie for both kids and adults alike. I highly recommmend this movie to anyone. The journey is one that will stay in your heart forever.",475
2,"i've read all of patricia's books and ofcourse loved 'em all. i think this is one of her best simply because it has been developed carefully with superb detail to the charecters' backgrounds and emotions. and for once, the killer and real suspense took a back seat. so what? i loved the good guys and what THEY thought!! really liked southern cross too--but there needs to be more between brazil and west!",405
2,"This CD is simply great. Jack Johnson is the most accomplished surfer/musician ever. If you like Ben Harper, get this album. Harper even makes an appearance on the album playing the slide guitar. This is a top-notch product.",224
2,"This CD was better than I'd hoped it was gonna be. I bought it after hearing the song ""Smokers Club"" w/ B-Lynch and Mr. Doctor, and found the CD that song was from. MC2 & JDOG are both really sick, I like their style, the beats are pretty sick on most of the tracks. I really like this CD, and you can get it for like $6 brand new now on Amazon or Ebay, so pick it up!Oh yea, and on the last track there is a hidden song that is real sick, so don't miss it!H.BIZZLE!",466
2,"Black is an awesome CD! No this aint death metal , but its a great Blues and Rock disc. Love it.",96

2,"The travel bed is great! I must have misunderstood that this was a used item though. I received it with no packaging, no instructions in a big box. It came quickly though and I figured it out. I'm sure we will use a lot.",220
2,"This is an amazing album. One of the best of the new female vocalist. I hear the live shows are amazing as well. If you like this album, give The Everybodyfields a listen. They are an alt-country band with some driving harmonies. Definately worth a listen...",258
2,"I picked these up for $10 while waiting for my Sony MDR-XD400's to be repaired. And while the sound of these cannot compare to those, these are amazing considering the price. The bass isn't that strong, nor are they especially loud, but such things cannot be expected from cans at a price like this. I would recommend these to anyone who does not expect audiophile quality from their phones, or if you need decent headphones at a good price.",441
2,This wagon is great! My 22 month old and 8 month old love it! There are seat belts so we can go across busy roads without anyone escaping! The wheels roll beautifully and the cup holders are perfect. I would recommend this wagon to anyone looking at all the different ones out there! My older son can pull my younger son (with supervision of course) and feel like a big boy. The wagon is sturdy and smooth so there is no worry about the little one!,448
2,A story that makes me thankful for all that I have. Our ancestors had a rough life that we take for granted. We don't really know how lucky we are.,147
2,"This cream is amusing! It did work to release some of the acne over night, I will recommend it to others.",105
2,"I bought a Grundig G6 and this antenna did help improve reception.When you try to retract the cable back, it does get stuck sometimes, like other reviewers said. However, the antenna does its job well enough, and it's cheaper than other similar antennas.",254

2,"Every adult Catholic would benefit from this copy of the Catechism. A very ""reader friendly"" way to learn and understand more fully the call to faith and the meaning of what it is to BE Catholic.Lives of saints and holy men and women included, along with prayers and devotional practices. Excellent!Used it with our adult Confirmation class.",341
2,"I have had this for just under a month. I fix boiled eggs almost every day and one of my issues is getting the shell off of the cooked egg. After cooking in this device, I roll the eggs in a coffee cup to break up the shells. The shells then come off very easliy with out any of the egg coming with them. The eggs taste great.",326
2,Love these boots. They are very comfortable. I wear them without sock and they keep my feet nice and warm.,106
2,I am amazed at how much both our dogs (puppy & adult) love this toy! After they have emptied everything out we reload and hide it in a new location. They get so excited when they find it and the fun starts all over again. We actually had to buy another so they can each have their own!,285
2,"I was fortunate enough to catch MT live in Bend, Oregon last weekend. It was also my first chance to hear the new material. All I can say is... wow! It comes across as a more refined product then their earlier albums (which I also love). For lack of a better term, a few songs almost come off as folksy pop tunes. There is not a bad track on the CD and the entire album is highly listenable. If you are looking for something new, give MT a shot... good people and great music!",476
2,"You really have to watch this movie carefully. Otherwise, you will lose the magic and just feel really bored with it.",117
2,"I love this book. The drawings are beautiful, and the story is heart-warming. It is helping explain adoption to my three-year-old Russian daughter while we wait to bring her baby brother home from Russia.",204
2,"This documentary re-affirms why I love this game so much. I'm a white male who speaks English and VERY broken Spanish (I basically only know soccer terms) but I've played with people speaking all different languages before, and this film accurately depicts how soccer (and sports in general) is the one true universal language that can build relationships between people that would otherwise never get to know each other. This is a must see for anyone, not just those who love soccer.",484
2,This story told through a child's voice and understanding is such a powerful truth. Syvia' s bravery in her youth and then in recounting her survival is amazing. I finish the book in 1 sitting because I couldn't stop. We are blessed to have this survivor remind us of what we truly must never allow to happen again.,315
2,"The book One fish, Two fish, Red fish, blue fish is one of the best childrens books I have read. Dr. Seuss books are always good, but this one is incredible. My favorite page is the one about the wet pet. One of the things that makes this book so good is the great illistrations. The words of the animals is so creative. It really lets a child figure out his own imagination and have alot of fun. The ryhming is truly genous. I loved it.Hi Mrs. Hopper!",452
2,"Bought the blue/heavy one and did the twist and release exercise. Of course it is hard to tell if just this has made by tennis elbow better as I took a lot of rest too, but after using it a few weeks my arm is a lot better. It's for sure worth the try. The best is after your arm is better is to focus on hitting a clean ball. I think especially bad serving and framing backhands are the source for tennis elbow...if you play tennis of course.",443
2,Nice Documentary could of been alittle long then what it was! alot of talking in it other then that a great documantary.,120
2,"We purchased this doll house for our granddaughter who ""just had to have it"" for her Barbies. She is four years old and has quite the imagination. We have had a lot of fun watching her play with it and playing with her, as well. It is a great size, perfect for many Barbies to play with at one time. It comes with many accessories, which she loves and folds up for easy storage. It is a perfect compliment for her Barbie collection and a great toy to expand every little girl's, and big girl's imagination.",506
2,Lovely work. Interesting exploration of the human form but would prefer a little more diversity to give a greater picture so to speak.,134
2,I recieved my treadmill two week ago and it is outstanding. Better then the treadmills at my high priced gym. I highly recommend buying this treadmill!,151
2,"I was excited to find they made a small, more compact case for my Kodak Z740 camera. All I've had up to this point, was a large camera bag with a strap that was much too bulky to carry normally. I also had no means of charging my camera batteries without hauling my charging dock with me whenever I went anywhere (not convenient for travel). Now, I not only have a compact case that will fit in my purse when I want to carry it with me, I also have a way to charge just my batteries!",483
2,"micheal is and always be the number one musical influence in my life.. i have come from an abusive childhood, to a abuse relationship, and now to a normal life, and one of the few things that has helped me through everything is his music. i think this album is great and hope to see more music from him soon.....",312
2,"To me this book is a great reference, as a young and low expirienced engineer I think the book has the basic formulas in most of the ingineering fields from highways to waste water treatment plant .",198
2,This is the second Pulsar I have own. The first has served me well as a dress watch for over 25 years. When I went looking for a replacement for my 20 year old casio G-Shock I wanted a better look and found it here without sacraficing features. This is a great value for the money. It functions as advertised and looks good too.,328
2,"This well acted suspenseful movie is well worth watching. We hadn't seen it since its original release, and probably enjoyed watching it as much this time as the first time.",173
2,"Susan Cooper's series is a masterpiece of adolesent literature. The classic elements of romance, good vs. evil and magic are all there in a masterful stroke where there is no word wasted. It combines Authorian legend in a modern setting. The story proceeds in a fashion that always leads on to the final confrontation of good and evil. Great!",342
2,"works well with my phone. i'm happy with the 4GB size as it makes it more convenient (and cheap) for me to just have my music and videos on one device instead of 2 (i.e. ipod + phone). the downfall, however, is the M2 adapter. it's not USB compatible and not sure what it's meant for, so i felt misled",301
2,"We have three cats and one dog and although we love our hardwood floors (and our cats), it's been a constant battle to keep the pet hair cleaned from the wood. The Swiffer Sweeper Vac has won the battle for us! It easily picks up all the stray pet hair. I use an old toothbrush to clean off the filter and all the stray hair goes right into the trash. Love this product!",370
2,"Very sweet collection of true stories, and inner peace. Very interesting to learn how important the free things in life can be.",127
2,"Bold and captivating, this alphabet concept book is a must have for the beginning reader. Not only is the story of the missing dot on the ""i"" appealing, but children can learn and enjoy the letter characters and detailed illustrations. This book would also be great for library story times and back to school themes. Another jewel from the ever-popular trove of the Wood family!",378
2,"Okay, so the material is a bit dated (back in 97) but thats okay since its still some of the better up and coming bands from the Chicago area. Its got the pseudo space rock of Kill Hannah, the nice dark wave of File Underwater, and the, well, just kinda cool and weird music of Plastic Princess (going to have to listen to these guys some more to make up MY mind, but hey they're from Chicago so hey have to be cool, right?). My only question is where can I get the book that inspired this stuff. Get it, listen to it, go see the bands.",536
2,"Like the previous two volumes, we enjoyed SOTW Vol. 3. It is written in an interesting and engaging style. My younger children enjoyed it as much as my third grader. Susan Wise Bauer does a good job handling some rather difficult and unpleasant parts of History. She did choose to leave out a couple of topics, but explains her reasons at the beginning. My only complaint is the lack of church history that is covered. (There seems to be a decreasing amount of church history covered in each successive volume.)",511
2,"While a very comprehensive book, getting me through some of the starting developer tools. This book left a little bit to be desired in documenting more on the ASP developing capabilities. Rather just telling you to ""check out the sample code"" which isn't bad advice (the sample code in Crystal Reports is fairly thorough) but I'd appreciate documentation on every possible Method, Property, etc. on the ASP Development objects in Crystal Reports.In short: any power user will appreciate this book, but developers might be left hanging somewhat.",544
2,"When I first listened to this disc, I was put off by its lack of melody. ""Nefertiti"" has a repeating motif (repeating too often, actually), and ""Masqualero"" has a melody. The rest seems like open jamming on a chord pattern.With Miles, Wayne Shorter, and Herbie Hancock, repeated listening to the playing and soloing pulls you in, and every note eventually becomes memorable. It gets to the point where you wouldn't want to change a note.I wasn't familiar with the songs before I got this disc, a veteran Davi listener may have a different reaction.",548
2,"or some reason, I am using a lot of bandaids s9o this is great. Perfect size and love the flexible fabric. Stays where you put it.",130
2,"Diana's single amazed me. I was cheering for her throughout the whole American Idol season, and I felt sure her single would be amazing. All three songs are beautiful and Diana sings them with passion and strong feeling. They'll send chills up your spine, yet they're all very catchy and you'll find yourself singing them often. ;) Must-buy for anyone who enjoys good music!",374
2,"After reading Stieg Larson's Millenium series I was stuck hoping for a lawsuit to sort out when the next book was going to rock my world from Sweden. Then along came Henning Mankell and Detective Wallander. The series is top notch story telling. Simple, beautiful and absolutely engaging. Have been reading these in order and love them. Also, have checked out the BBC series and have been impressed with the showa. A+ !",419
2,"Excellent juicer, very powerful, the feet chute is wide enough to accomodate even medium sized apples and large cucumbers as well. It's not as loud as I expected and meshes aesthetically with my other modern appliances. The pulp is bone dry (with a slower juicing hand) and a lot of juice is extracted from each piece of fruit/vegetable. All in all it was money well spent and is a product I use often. It's also very easy to clean!",432
2,"It has been years since I have been able to purchase this foundation and let me tellyou that ITS THE BEST! The long lasting coverage foundations today dont come close to this. This is the best there is. BUY IT! Buy as many as you can. This covers flawlessly. Scars, acne, dark circles and let me tell you it goes on lightcoverage but a heavy coverage. Its the best. USE IT WET! Wet sponge, and pat the product and then lightly smooth. Its easy. It is amazing and you cant go wrong.",481
2,"The sounds on this CD will melt your brain. If that sounds like a good thing to you - it does to me - then by all means buy it. It's one of the greatest recordings in the ""contemporary instrumental"" genre, a beautifully cut jewel laying in a field of boring stones. I would love to hear more from this trio.",307
2,"This devotional is wonderful. It talks about everything a teenage girl wants and needs to know about, from giving of yourself to dating. It has really helped me become closer to God as well as teaching me many things. If you are a teenage girl looking for a good devotional I would definately recomend this book.",312
2,My son enjoys the Dinosaur Train adventures and loves learning about dinosaurs at the same time. This cartoon is not annoying to adults either.,143
2,"My baby loves this gym. The bright colors really attract his attention. The blanket is really great for ""tummy time"""", also. We registered for this one, not really knowing how it compared with the others. I'm glad we did. It's well worth the money.",248
2,"I love the dvd. My only complaint is that they messed this dvd up when transfering over. I saw DM twice last year and i have to say ... Martin Gore's voice is too low in the mix here. I mean extremely low. Dave Gahan's is fine but they screwed Gore on this. Pretty dissapointed with this. However, for anyone who didn't catch this live show- its a must. For those that did, its a nice reminder of how amazing these guys are live.",429
2,"I bought a spool of this line to use in my Echo string trimmer that has the ""Two string insertable trimming head"". This is the strongest, toughest, longest lasting trimmer string that I have ever used.One problem that I can see is for the manufacturer in that it lasts twice as long as the orange line and I will not need to replace it near as often.",350
2,"Gritty, tough and rough. It may take a while to get in the saddle, but once you're there, you don't give up until you have taken the entire ride with these unforgettable characters. Not everyone will appreciate the reality expressed --- the corruption of the young country is revealed in a stark portrayal. But, it's a fine read, and the images don't fade fast from your memory. It reminds us of the struggle to be born...and to morph into something finer. We are left waiting for the next chapter.",498
2,"Robot Chicken is one of those series people either LOVE or HATE, I happen to be on the love side, but I don't think you could ever convince someone to enjoy it if they didn't. This is a great send-up of the Star Wars movies, so if you are a Star Wars nerd like me, it's probably worth a watch even if you have never seen Robot Chicken, and if you are a fan of the series, you don't need my help deciding whether you like it or not.",431
2,"I loved this movie, and who is that crazy little guy who accompanies Brando wherever he goes? He looks just like Karen's dog, Zoonie. Don't miss this movie for this reason alone.",178
2,"After using a Sunbeam mixer for 35 years, I needed to replace my worn-out friend. I shopped and compared products and prices for a couple years. I knew about the wonderful KitchenAid mixers reputation from friends and opted for that brand. I found Amazon.com offering a new KitchenAid Artisan mixer for $242.00. Wow, such a deal! No tax, no shipping and a $30 rebate from KitchenAid! Buying from Amazon saved me $88.00, and I became one very-pleased shopper.",458

2,"One of the best Cd's ever, this was the first title I had from this band.so thier later efforts are heavier, not as good, more dream theater like. This one stands alone with an original sound. The lyricks make sense the music intense but not overdone. out of over 7000 titles that I own, this is at the top of the stack. It really should be up with dark side of the moon (pink floyd), Van halen, queensrych or anything else ever realesed. My favorate CD !",455
2,"I first read this book as a beginner looking to get into reining. I found it easy to understand and the concepts very clear. I still refer to it constantly for training and conditioning tips. It's a very well written book, and is not at all 'difficult' to read. In fact, I found it hard to put down! A great book and well worth a look.",335
2,"The interesting adventure of a young girl exploring writing and immigrating are terrific. The Silver Pencil has it's own unique flavor; strange at first, but then wonderful as you get into it!!!",194

2,"The best Bon Jovi album ever. So rock and roll and so hard! Riffs and lyrics are unbelievable. Should get more credit and more promotion. Definitely a positive album and inspirational. The songs tell great stories. I've had the album for 7 months now and I still listen to it constantly. That RARELY happens to any CD I buy, even Bon Jovi. It's the best! Not too crazy about the extra tracks, but the CD is great and worth having! Also don't like having to wait 15 minutes between track 12 and 13.",497
2,Get the online code since it is safer and then having xbox auto renew your god membership. Once you pay for it you get the code and your up and running. 10 bucks cheaper than getting through xbox too.,200
2,"Perhaps the surprise album of the year. Paul Anka takes some of the most popular rock songs of the past few years, the arranger takes these songs down to the basest level and totally redoes them, a huge studio orchestra is added and viola you have a very very good album. Certainly not your typical Paul Anka fare. Note the reference to Frank Sinatra on 'It's My Life' to Pauls' penned 'My Way'. Outstanding are Bon Jovis' 'Jump' and Eric Claptons' 'Tears In Heaven' but the whole album is worth buying.",503
2,"This tape is good for everything, i have used to fix things around the house and even the my car.",97
2,"Henry Kuttner was a master of thoughtful, humorous and bitter scifi. He was so prolific that he used at least 5 pen names, including Lewis Padgett. My all time favorite story is ""Mimsy Were The Borogroves"". If that story doesn't give you shudders, then you are no longer alive. His stuff was well written, well plotted and wonderfully presented. If you have never read Kuttner, I envy you. Reading him for the first time is an amazing experience. Please get this book, in whatever form you can.",494
2,"I didn't think I could get through a book faster than I had read The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara -Ilse Witch. But I suprised myself with Antrax. I finished way too soon. Terry Brooks gets me so involved with his characters that I don't want the story to end. And when it does, I can't wait for the next one. I waited a year for Antrax to come out in paperback. I won't wait for Morgawr -- I'm ordering it right now!",416

2,"I wandered into a book store to find Peter Nichols there for a book signing, he spoke of his journey, his life before and after setting sail, he read from his book and I was glad I had the chance to meet him. I found the book riveting at times and a comfortable cruise at other times. I recomend it not only to someone who has an interest in the sea (I never did before this book) but to anyone whoever loved or hopes to love for I found it as much of a love story as a journal of the wooden ship of days goneby, now crossing the ocean. Get and read this book",559
2,Every child who comes to our house & plays this game is hooked and asks to play next time. I am a teacher by profession and this is a very unintimidating logic & reasoning game (for all ages)- I would highly recommend! I have just ordered 5 more to give as x-mas gifts this year.,279

2,"Almost as good as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but more of a kid's story.Very enjoyable even so",97
2,"I loved this movie and the soundtrack! The vocals are excellent and so are the lyrics. Most of the songs are super but I didn't like My Lovey Dovey baby. It is sooooooooooooooo annoying! but all the songs overide that icky track.My favorite songs are Seize the Day, Sante Fe, and The World Will Know.I reccomend this CD to anyone who loved the movie.",350
2,"Very good Batman movie. My favorite of the 3 that star Christian Bale. Wanted to see it in the theater, but the stream over Amazon Prime was good.",146
2,"I highly recommend Ms. Sprenger's book. I want to invite her to speak at an education conference but am having difficultly locating her. If any one has information about how I can reach her, I would appreciate it. Even a clue, like what state or city does she reside in, would be very helpful. Of course an e-amil address is preferable.",336
2,If you like the old Twilight Zone TV stories you will love Twilight Zone The Movie. This is a collection of some of their best stories redone on better sets to a higher standard.,178
2,"I read reviews on several Forearm Crutches before I decided on these. They are worth every bit of the money. Comfortable and gave me the support I needed getting over knee surgery. They are well built and not too heavy. My husband is having his knee surgery in a few weeks and will also use them. I'm 5'2"" and he is 5'9"". They adjust well to both of our heights. I highly recommend them! An added plus..they were delivered fast!",428

2,"One of the greatest bands of all time, QUEEN here is in one of the best concerts when they where in top of their career, circa 1984. It contains all the major hits fromo ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" to ""Another One bites the dust"", too bad they missed some late 80's hits like ""Hammer to Fall"" or ""Radio Ga Ga"" but overall is a great DVD with some cool extras like trivia and pictures.",376
2,Love love love how she wrote this book. Good for both men and women alike. I like how she referred to the Word and also used her own personal experienced to relate to the audience.,180
2,"I bought this angled gauge along w/ a regular (flat) guage to adjust the valve gap on my ATV. Much to my dismay the thinnest was thicker than the gap spec, so it turned out to be useless. I kept it because it is otherwise a quality gauge. The regular gage had the thicknesses needed, so I'm glad I bought both.",310
2,"Somebody at Amazon is playin' tricks on my mind! I haven't heard this CD, but I'm a little bit annoyed that, when I'm searching for Karajan's version(s), this one comes up. David Hurwitz, an Amazon reviewer, doesn't like Karajan that much, so I wonder if he rigged it to go to this version. Oh well--the DG ""Originals"" series is so great, I'm sure this version is one of the best. But I wish Amazon would just let me search for the music without second-guessing my tastes. I want KARAJAN, so give me KARAJAN!",508

2,"Lori Gammon's step by step common sense guide is THE thing for fulfilling the threesome fantasy. Lori provides a light hearted approach and explains that the Threesome Fantasy can become reality. I particularly enjoyed this book because its writing style is relaxed, informative and gives the reader the can-do attitude. A must read for anyone who has ever entertained the threesome fantasy-and who hasn't?",406

2,Jenna Reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish.

2,The DVD of On the Beach arrived in very good shape and in a shorter time than I expected. We were very pleased with this.,121
2,"It's probably easier to read this book now that we have a new Browns team in place. It makes me a little more understanding of what Modell went through before his grievous decision.It is fun to get an insider's look at some of the issues over the years: Kosar's release, Belicheck, etc.",286
2,"This album's quite good, and the best tracks are 2,4,6,8,9,10, and also that remix of track 4 on #12. Everybody's just better sounding in rhymes and beats than their solos, even though their solos are hella tight, too.",218
2,"I have a small Grizzly CNC, so I wanted a small vise when I wasnt just fixing parts to the table.1. The angular base is removable, and just the vise can mount to the table. In this configuration it would be nice if there where pins to meet standard ""T"" slots to hold parallel w/o too much setup time.All of the edges are SHARP, burrs and all. I had to file everything down, which only took about 5 minutes.Like I noted though, good value/price",443

2,"I bought this CD for my daughter, and ended up taking it back from her. After listening to it several times, I thought as a song writer, this is what I'd write, but Jennifer's talent brings it all to the top, she's so in the pocket, great layers, melodies, and most of all it gets your spirit moving! Great work from a new artist! I'm looking forward to her new work.",367

2,"I have become lactose intolerant for several years. I always avoid ice cream though I love it.. until I heard about Lactaid from a coworker.In my wallet I put one of these chewable tablets. Now before I eat ice cream I pop the Lactaid, which gives me 30 minutes to enjoy the ice cream. Nice.I have a hard time swallowing pills, so chewable tablet is perfect for me. I highly recommend this for anyone.",401

2,Great book. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone that is interested in the Hell's Angels MC. But it!,113
2,A remake of the first evil dead. It's more comical than the first installment as ash the chainsaw bearing triger happy badass battles more of the evil dead. I thought it was a great movie and am glad it is now avable agian. Army of darkness picks up were evil dead2 leaves off it was almost called evil dead3 but universal studios wanted the movie to stand on its own.Hope you injoy it as much as I did. END,407
2,Got one of these for my wife and me (men's version) because every time we went for a ride after about a half hour it was majorly uncomfortable...We've been riding on these saddles for 2 weeks now and keep noting how it's so much more fun to ride without the 'back pain'!This did the trick for us!,296

2,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who has read about Zen, or is up on the theories of paying positive attention to NOW. It provides the practical advice on how to pay attention, even in the middle of a modern western life. It's done wonders for my peace of mind (2 small children can divide anyone's attention). There's not a lot of discussion of theory, or why Zen and attention are good or important, simply a lot of ways to achieve them. Highly recommended.",462
2,Bought this for my grandaughter who is a music teacher and also getting married. She really loved this gift! It is very nicely done and there is a CD fo the music in the book.,175

2,Every year I buy a scorebook to take to NY Yankees games. This is the best one I've found. It has the most room for notations and player replacements. The spiral binding is sturdy. It has room for 25 games. I cut and paste and print the team rosters from Yahoo. It saves a bundle off buying the program.,303
2,The only thing wrong with this CD is that there are too few selections. Danny O'Flaherty is the best Celtic singer I've ever heard. This collection is an absolute must. You will never tire of this music.,203
2,"I use this to message trigger points in my upper & mid back, as well as my upper traps and neck. It's very helpful in reaching otherwise difficult spots. My problems are quite chronic so this hasn't fully alleviated my trigger points but with more use I'm sure it will. I've found this works well with the ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"" which you can buy here on Amazon.",376
2,"If you are concerned with the re-usability of plastic water bottles and are unsure what to buy, then this product is for you. If, like me, you are concerned with the durability of just about any item; this product is for you. The only reason it doesn't have a five-star rating is because it is not dishwasher safe and it is suggested that putting the Klean Kanteen in a refrigerator is a bad idea. Fill it up twice and you have your daily dose of H20.",451
2,Fabulous! I take one to work with me every day. I feel deprived without my daily bar!,85
2,"While this unit is rather bulky, I love how it can charge 8 AA batteries at the same time. Also its ability to charge AA, C, D, and 9v batteries makes this the ultimate charger.The smart charge works well by ensuring the batteries are charged to their optimal levels so that they last a very long time.Works great in my Wiimotes!",329
2,"I've always been somewhat skeptical with these microwavable items, but this is a GREAT little item to have! Fast and easy! I received mine yesterday and had to test it right away. 8 minutes for medium cooked centers (using jumbo eggs) and 10 minutes for hard. The bottom is hot, so use a towel or something to handle it once you are ready to remove it from the microwave.",371

2,"A very complete book written at a time when antibiotics were not the norm. I appreciate the candor, the openness and frankness the author uses -- also some of the language is amusing. I appreciate what this female Dr. had to go through during a time in history that was very tough, and all the case histories she gathered to make this book outstanding. Much insite gained. Good reference.",388
2,"If you want to experience the lounge/downtempo side of Seattle, buy this CD. Of course my boyfriend is on it and he will be coming out with a cd soon. He will also be featured in Mary Lydia Ryan's new CD as well. Song #15, Sugarless, Stefan Mendez...yes, his name is spelled wrong.",281
2,This book was recommended by my son's drum teacher and they use it often in his lessons. My son is a young teen and is happy with the song selections in this book.,163
2,"This isn't my favorite Date book by any means, but it does go into the finer details or Codd's work and it does so at a level that really does Codd's work justice.If you aren't really into Codd's work, and you are trying to find an intro to DB Theory, this definitely isn't for you. However, if you are looking for a great theoretical analysis of one of the greatest mind's in Computer Science, this is a great book.",416

2,"For those of you feeling their way into Super-Audio CD, one will note the unevenness of the sound engineering of many reissues in this new format, most are extraordinary but some are simply a compressed file reprinted for SACD. Rest assured that the sound engineers did their job well for the late Mr. Gould. I have listened to the 44khz CD version of this recording a hundred times over a dozen years. But with this SACD I was hearing more, much more. Put this one high on your list!",484
2,If you are looking for alot of action this movie is it. But in getting this movie you have to get part 2 as well for an even better ride.,137
2,I am enjoying my CD very much. It came packaged as advertised and arrived promptly.,83
2,"Randall Hicks book is written in an informative way- but maintains a warmth towards the many emotions involved in adoption. I used this book as a guide for our own adoption and it helped me through many of the issues- from the beginning decisions surrounding the type of adoption process we wanted- through the final court date. The legal advice is accurate, but the advice surrounding the emotions on both sides of adoption is invaluable.",439
2,"""Mind Your Own Business"" originally aired on 5/26/56. This is the episode where, in part on Ralph's advice, Ed gets fired from his job in the sewer and starts selling irons door-to-door. It does not work out, but he eventually gets his old job back. There is some suspense in the episode as Ed tells Ralph that he is very successful in selling the irons when in reality he is not.",380
2,I have loved the Crunchie bar since I was a kid. They were so hard to find then and so expensive. Buying by the box can be dangerous but very cost effective. This is a great price. Careful of ordering during the warm season. Mine arrived a little melted. However they set back up fine and tasted perfect.,304
2,"Loved it! As good or better than Shawn of the Dead. Great acting, very funny! I would highly recommend it.",106
2,purchase experience was very good. Delivery was fast and product exactly what I ordered.,88
2,"I bought these shoes for my wedding and couldn't be happier with them. They are pretty with a little spice with the gold and patent leather white stripes. They just add a certain something to my ensemble for the big day, and couldn't be any better! Low heel, quite comfortable, these are great shoes (in any color!)",315
2,"This is an awsome product. The software is great, and it is very fun to play with. The first time you plug in your GPS to your Handspring, it will take a long time (about 5 min.) to link up with the satlites, but after that, it takes about 10-20 sec. If you ever wanted a GPS, this is the one!",293
2,"Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for with a great price and arrived in a timely manner looking great! I keep it at my desk and I got one of these for a friend. We try to use a word from it in our emails to each other which gets us out of a vocabulary rut and can be pretty funny, as well. Thank you!",302

2,"I saw this film when I was 10 years old and I don't remember getting much sleep afterwards. If you want a decent scare I'd recommend this film for it far outways the films that follow. This is a genuine thrill ride with state of the art effects and a creepy as hell plot. A murderer comes back as a doll and starts killing everyone. Brilliance. Too bad it could never be repeated, at least not effectivly.",405
2,"Great transfer of the cult classic, with lots of extra production picts, movie trailer, and informative color booklet!",118
2,"What a great clean entertaining movie.I really, really enjoyed it. I felt like dancing in the theater both times I saw it. Enjoyed the soundtrack and I'm impatiently waiting for the release of the video. FUN! Fun! FUN!",218
2,"and it is deserved. This album is one of the best I heard for long.4 singers with individual and extraordinary voices. One cannot decide if one is better than the other. But there is no need anyway, as they are unbeatable together.Would like to see you live but I learned that this will not happen anymore. Such a shame!!!",322
2,"For critics of this book, the author explains in the preface that calling this book ""complete"" is a marketing tool--albeit one that is a bit misleading--and that there is no way a reference on Crystal Reports will be ""complete"" enough to answer every single quesion. Granted there are ways the book could be improved (more screen shots, more typical scenarios, etc) but so far this is the best CR 9.0 book that I have found. Perhaps book publishers should consider this.",470
2,This is a great toy for little ones. My son had one like this and it was his favorite toy for years! I recently bought this for my 2yr old nephew and he liked it right away as well. It is very life like and makes great trash truck noises that the kids seem to love. I would recommend this over other similar trash trucks that I've seem at other places.,352
2,"It doesn't get better than this. The album ranks in my top 5 favorites with 2 songs (Telling Stories and Unsung Psalm) in my top 5 favorite songs ever. Soul shattering and rebuilding. I'm a country white boy, go figure; who knew?",229
2,"I've read a number of Kay Hooper's books, and this one is just as great as every other one I've read. It's got the same elements are the other works that I loved, the romance, the suspense, the action, et cetera. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in less than 8 hours. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has ever read anything else that Kay Hooper has written!",408

2,"Put simply tis documentary is a fascinating informative look behind the creation of one of the greatest albums of the 1980s.Paul Simon and the african musicians break down many of the songs - chord by chord, lyric by lyric and reveal the very personal journey this album was for all.A great balance of interviews, clips of live performances and of some of the music videos. If you are a fan of music then you will not be disappointed.",434
2,"Product was as advertised and arrived on time. The groves in the mat are pretty deep, and therefore a little more difficult to clean out, but they do trap dirt and water which is what a floor mat should do,",206
2,"I enjoyed this movie and the casting is great. It is about the conflicts between the mafia and American Italian policeman that were born and raised in the same neighborhoods. The leading female role played by Mia Sara is the wife to ""Joey"" the police officer in the film. I think there are 1-2 actors from the HBO Sopranos in this film too. This film was made before the Sopranos became a big hit. I recommend this film.",420
2,"Unlike the reviews below, this feeder has given us excellent service. I purchased this for my Mother to use. Her backyard is Squirrel Central and she is always on the lookout for a feeder for feathered critters, not furry ones.This feeder is very easy to fill and to date no squirrels has been observed successfully getting any seed out of it. Which isn't to say they don't try, but so far their schemes have failed them. The saga continues....",444
2,I purchased this case to use with a 1TB Toshiba portable hard drive. Overall the case is well made and well designed if you want to carry two portable drives. I currently have both the Toshiba drive and a Western Digital Passport in the case. I guess in the long run it saves me from buying another case but it really is too big for most portable drives (my lacie rugged drive does not fit).,391
2,The ease of use is perfect for beginners like me. I have a few books on this subject and i would recommend it to others. Good recipes,133
2,"These Windham Hill Christmas CDs are amazing, the first two being my all-time favorites.

2,"After reading ""More than 85 Broads"" I was truly overwhelmed with feelings of awe and inspiration. Not only does each woman have such courage and fire but the progression of the book is magnificent. The best thing I did was to ""pay it forward"" and buy the book for my mother and aunt - both of whom have been equally touched.",324
2,"This clever little thing is SO handy for walks, restaurants and car trips. I don't know why they're so hard to find; I bought mine from a random endcap display at Kroger, and have never seen them elsewhere. A great gift, too. Works exactly as advertised, and when it gets crusty, just toss it in the wash or dishwasher.",319
2,It was very easy access to order this product from Amazon. I ordered and received the product in record time and I am very appreciative of the fine service.,156
2,"When I first saw Paul Mercurio in ""Strictly Ballroom"" I immediatley fell in love. In Exit To Eden, you get to see more of him to love--literally. He has the most perfect body you'll ever see in your entire lifetime. The whipping scene is so great on so many levels. The comedy is okay, but the visual jokes are great, and the costumes are fabulous. I loved this movie.",368
2,"This is the first serger I have ever used. I was afraid to thread it but the accompanying dvd and written directions made it easy. I've swapped out the thread and the needles multiple times with very little effort except threading the needles due to space limitations for your hands, but there are tools for that which I am considering. Some of the manual is incorrect but it's easy enough to figure out what they are trying to say. It's a nice compact size so I can have it on the same table as my sewing machine and switch between them easily.",545

Strongly encourage anyone who loves the Queen's english and British humor to buy this DVD.",381
2,"Similarly to the other reviews, I too was entranced by this heart-warming novel. Although the story is about heartache, the characters make it a heart-warming tale. I couldn't put this book down. I also fell in love with each and every character. Alan Brennert has an amazing work that is above and beyond my expectations.",322

I've never knitted socks before, and I can't really tell you why I want to now, but for some reason I was intrigued by the process, and now I can do it!!! I Definitely recommend this book to beginner-intermediate knitters.",516

2,"The cake pan works allright except it waas sticking in a fewplaces. This may be because a recipe was not included in theorder so I used my own recipe. I was under the impression thata recipe was supposed tobe included but it wasn't. Could youpossibly send me one? I would appreciate that very much,Thankyou. BERTHA CRICH",320
2,"I read this book because, like Julia Child, I discovered a deep passion for cooking late in life. This book made me realize that you are never too old to try something new and have a wonderful adventure. Julia was as natural a writer as she was a cook, and the story flows along beautifully. I also learned a lot about the post-WWII adjustments faced by France, and was able to use the book when teaching my high school U.S. History classes about WWII.",452
2,"I purchased three Misto oil sprayers and I love them. I used one for vegetable oil, one for olive oil and one for soy sauce. It is easy to use suitable for BBQ and home cooking.",177
2,"Eric Schlossers' Fast Food Nation, was one of the greatest books I have ever read. Schlosser first outlines the given topic, then puts it into real life perspecitve while managing to explain who, what, when, where, and most explicitly why and how. Reading this book made me think about labor and quality from an economic view and then again from a moral view. Fast Food Nation is organized and explained very clearly. In my personal opinion this should be mandatory school reading, and anyone who hasn't read this book yet, should at least give it a shot.",555
2,"My girls love to play with their play kitchen and to cook and bake! Santa brought this set of cupcakes and they are great. They are shape sorters, and yummy cupcakes! They fit perfect into their play oven. These are also made from quality materials.",249
2,"Basically, if you like what you see in the picture, you like this item. Its 2 inches wide and about 2 3/4 inches tall -- the perfect size picture frame magnet for a dorm fridge!",177
2,"This tape has everything you need to know about the Grand Canyon.It's beautiful and educational.After watching this,I want to visit there again and see some of things I didn't have time for.Highly recommended!",209
2,"This book is required reading for those of us who are struggling to keep the folly of ""Creationism"" out of our public schools. Want to prevent a Kansas School Board mentality from denying your children a modern education? Read this book. See also Carl Sagan's ""The Demon Haunted World"".",286
2,"It's a shame that the public has to dig for the truth rather than rely on the press to be honest, but that's the situation. If you really want to know what was going on rather than buy into the juvenile theory that this was somehow all about W's oil buddies, this is a great start.",281
2,"I loved About a Boy and really, really loved the sardonic wit of High Fidelity. About a Boy is much deeper but just as cynical. Maybe even more so. The characters are richly drawn and just complex enough to keep the reader wanting more. Good read, but best to take some time with this one. Not recommended for a summer beach read.",330
2,"I practice Raviana Kundalini Yoga 5-7 times a week. I am enjoying a mental, spiritual and emotional transformation as a result. Body Electric has become one of my favorite practices. I embrace the challenge of this DVD and feel such strength, peace and energy afterwards. Thank you Ravi and Ana. You do so much for so many and I am so grateful that I am one of them.Blessings and joy, Sat Nam.",393
2,"quite simply, if you are a fan of Twin Peaks, then you need this album. it's lovely nighttime music that is spooky and serenely beautiful with flourishes of jazz and new age. Julie's vocals are sweet and tender and float right over the music. you can't help but think of scenes from the Twin Peaks television series when you play this cd at home. everytime i hear it, it makes me want to break out my old vhs box set, make some coffee and cherry pie, and watch the whole series from start to finish.",499
2,This player works great. I have had none of the problems with the SonicStage file management software that others have reported. The software does exactly what it is supposed to and is not diffucult to use. I love this player - its everything I expected.,254
2,"I saw these 4 awsome guys at a Church camp. The music that they played really helped me get closer to God. Not only that, but they sing from their hearts. God really has blessed them. The best song that Lane wrote is ""Surrender to The Fire."" their music is the best I've ever heard. And I just can't get enough of it.",317
2,The book is very helpful for the novice photographer. It was an assigned book in a photography class I took for the summer. I thought it would be a ho-hum book but it was better than I thought. The book includes photo examples of exposures and setting which is very helpful. If you are just starting out this book should be just what you need. Even if you have been taking good pictures for sometime by pure luck you will be able to fine tune your skills with the help of this book.,482
2,"I never saw this in a theatre, but I bought the DVD right away because I enjoy this type of film. Well, I was more than entertained! The Special Effects are outstanding, sets and atmosphere are solid. Perhaps this is better seen at home...I don't know. I DO know that I was very entertained. Those who analyze stuff will not like it. To me, this was a composite of all the dumb stuff I enjoy watching to escape the drudgeries, etc. I'm glad to have this in my collection. It's so silly, and so much fun!",503
2,this series is very good. patrick stewart is an amazing actor. i have always enjoyed the star trek tv series,108
2,"I love this coffee pot. Really hot coffee and I use less coffee grounds than when I used a drip pot. However, the heating elements burn out too quickly. That's why I bought more than one pot, so I'd have another one one hand. Makes the best coffee ever! Geri",258
2,This book absolutely changed my life!!! ..... As I was reading it -- the Holy Spirit was ever present ....... and I was on my knees in reverent prayer to God at the end of the book. God reaches out to everyone in different ways - and this book was one of those ways for me. I was so touched and moved - that I bought copies for everyone in my Bible Study group. I cannot recommend this book enough.,398
2,"Love In Stereo is another excellent work from Mr. Patterson. His voice is unique, polished and would sound great even with ho-hum production. But wait, Rahsaan adds some of the greatest production that R&B has seen in years. And to top it off his lyrics are positive and avoid the trappings of today's braggadocio and overt sexuality. If you only buy one album this year, you could make a strong case for this one to be it. If you buy two, get his debut it is also excellent.",475
2,"Nazalia is very pretty, pink looks very good on her. I like her eyeshadow glitter and her glittery lipstick . She comes with very cute acceries like a glittery snowman.These dolls with the Snowlodge can make it seem like winter all year long. Like, in Summer that bratz can take a trip to maine to go skiing in the skii lodge or something.I like, Ailani too and am thinking about purchasing Nazalia so far it looks like I might!",428
2,"The only reason we purchased this machine was to convert a big set of VHS tapes to DVD. The Recorder is fairly easy to use for this purpose, but we have had some issues with the DVDs made. On some DVD players we have had issues playing the DVDs. Hopefully this is an isolated thing with the specific type of DVD player we have at the office. We haven't yet tested it on a broad range of DVD players.",399
2,"This cd is definitely a winner. Shania's singing abilities really shine through. The music is so fun-you never get sick of it, and it's really fun to sing along to. This is also great music to dance to. It's got a fast beat and it's just plain fun! If you buy this cd, you won't regret it!",289
2,I really like this unit. The rollers have great clamps that make them stay on. It is compact for travel also.,109
2,Just spellbinding. I was enthralled and could not put this one down. Kagan creates characters that are so human. This subject is a very hard one and she handles it with grace.Can't wait for her next book! Keep up the good work.,227
2,The bass on these headphones is amazing. They're very comfortable but the sound quality leaves a bit to be desired. Overall they are a good deal for the price.,159
2,"Crushing , technicly crushing your vocals and ear drums",55
2,"I was a little put off by the Barbara K logo, but it had what I was looking for. I wanted an ""upstairs"" screwdriver, one to keep in a drawer for little repairs upstairs without having to go to the well-stocked workshop in my basement. This isn't a girlie-man tool, it's a solid, journeyman screwdriver. Magnetic bits of enough sizes and a light that either shines where you're pointing the tool or detaches. The only thing more I would have liked for this type of tool would have been a ratcheting mechanism.",508
2,This book is the only one of its kind on the market. It actually tells you what you will be realistically facing and how to prepare and the resources it points you to are excellent for example I signed up for an online first year prep course called learninglaw aristotle recommended by the book and found it to be the most valuable info. I had going into my first year. Also knowing what the selection process is like from an insiders perspective really helped me calm down as I waited for my acceptance letter.,511
2,I bought four different books and this one is the best. Nice step by step learning curve. Doesn't introduce unnecessary complex stuff in the beginning to put you to sleep.,171
2,"This book is meant to be heard. It almost like getting a three hour therapy session for 15 bucks. Dr. Gullo is right on the money almost 100% of the time with his observations and recommendations. I have listened to the book twice already and I plan to listen to it again whenever my diet falters. If you are ready to live life as thin person starting today, you want to buy this CD.",383
2,"Balsam was a musician's musician. This CD is excellent, glorious, and, if you really love classical music, an important addition to your collection.",148
2,"Henry Morton is one of the most engaging and well characterized detectives in historical fiction today. A Bow Street Runner at the turn of the 19th century, Morton catches criminals for reward money--a somewhat unsavory profession in this time before Scotland Yard. From the peek behind the stage door as Morton trades repartee with his mistress, to the real-life corruption of Bow Street, to the snapshot of the uglier side of the criminal classes... The Thief Taker is a deftly written historical mystery with a great ending. Highly recommended.",547
2,"34 y/o male, bought this for discoloration and sagging under eyes, it actually worked in 3 days of use. I'm in shock, as I expected minimal effects - instead, I have gotten noticeable results. Wow, what a great product. I hope it keeps getting better, but even if it just stays this good, I will be happy!",305
2,"I didn't even know it came out. My sister sends me my birthday present (late), I open it and am just ecstatic!!! I loved this show when I was a kid. And I stayed up until 2:30 watching the night I got it. Still is a great show. Now I just can't wait for the second series to come out. I will be first in line to get it.The quality is very nice (except for the behind-the-scenes feature). Wish there were more extras (got spoiled by Star Wars). But this is definitely worth getting. Thanks Sis.",493
2,I love my Timex watch because it is easy to read and keeps excellent time. It is attractive to look at and very comfortable thanks to the velco band closure. The digital readout is perfect for me since I am 77years of age and find it difficult to see the small lines on my usual watch. Now I always know what time it really is!!!,329
2,"Arrived very fast. The book is wonderful too! It took me a couple of dozen pages to get into the rhythm of the style, but once I did I was totally immersed in the sea.",167
2,"It was kind of disheartening to know there were no more Harry Potter books to come out, but then I found these books to replace them. They are fantastic! I can't wait for the fourth book and the movies to come out!",214
2,"I've used these oils before and they are absolutely wonderful. However, I ordered this trio for a friend's birthday and was unhappy with the Amazon sticker put smack-dab in the middle of the top of the box. I tried to carefully peel it off which made things just as bad! The box was designed to be suitable for a gift, but Amazon ruined that option!!!",351
2,"Used this kit on a '98 Maxima, replacing OEM non-Bose radio. Kit required some modifications, but step by step directions were included and were complete",153
2,I have her CDs playing in my car and in my home. Her improvisation skills are top notch. Beyond Bach is one of my favorite pieces in this collection. Her other pieces are excellent as well. You can also find her interview on NPR.,229

2,I love this CD. The songs are peppy and the lyrics are great. Her voice and range is amazing,92
2,Very fast response to my request. Excellent condition of the book. Would heartily recommend.,92
2,"Very good book for beginners. If you have been turning pens for a while you will not find this book as informative. However, they have some pretty good ideas on turning pens and adding different materials to make into pens. The book is worth the money for a beginner or even an experienced pen turner wanting to brush up on the basics.",335

2,"Overall, a very well designed and functional product. Too bad that the edges and corners of the aluminum sheet components had to be deburred, and the corners had to be rounded. If not done, the edges could cut your hands and the corners could tear your clothes or upholstery in your wehicle. Seems like fewer and fewer manufacturers are likely to completely finish their products anymore. I guess hand finishing is too expensive. That's why manufacturers are going overseas for cheap labor and hand finishing.",509
2,If you want to save money on batteries this is the way to go. After reading other reviews we had no problems. With four controller we are always ready.,151

2,"I have became the biggest fan of Joan Sutherland lately, and I bought this set because of her. And I'm not diappointed at all. In fact, I'm elated. Not only do I get to hear THE DAME in wonderful voice, but got some lovely music and other charming singers as an added bonus. This cd has made me a Mozart fan. HIGHEST recommendation I can make!!!",345
2,"I Have the version that is imported from australia, but I think all the cooking for pump-kin tracks are all the same,just different covers. This cd isnt that great really but the tracks that are good are worth four stars.",221

2,This books touches on relegious aspects of the modern days. It touches on important points of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that the New and Old Testament leave out. For anyone who has the desire to better themselves this book is the one for you.,243
2,"I thought this book was extremely good. I enjoyed the characters, the setting, and the sensuality. I highly recommend this books to people who like strong historical romances.",175
2,This is great if you're tired of looking for the right lid to fit in a cabnet. It organizes them by size. Wonderful idea!,121
2,"this is by far the best book I have ever read. the book has absolutely everything in it....good vs. evil, rags to riches, politics, war, inspiration, redemption.story could have happened today, and it was set over 70 years ago.I highly recommend!Michael AxelrodShort Hills, NJ",276
2,"Was turned on to this moisturizing cream when I received a sample sized tube at my dermatologist's office. Super rich cream that needs to be massaged in to penetrate, but once it does... Lasts all day! Heals any cracks/dry areas within a couple of applications. Fragrance free. Highly recommend. Do not waste your money on something you would buy at the supermarket. Spend the extra money, you'll be glad you did! Buy multiple tubes to qualify for free shipping.",462
2,"this book was written 1700 years ago, and still, now people still read it, and i think it's a great book that really makes you smarter, and it really makes me think that only the complicated chinese can express feelings that well, english is too young and simple.",263
2,"This book is great. It covers all the highlights throughout history. I homeschool my 2 children and we use it almost daily. My favorite parts are the internet links. Lots of details, in-depth information.",204
2,I love the book...couldn't be more pleased with everything! I know I'll treasure this book for the rest of my life and will share it with my friends and family...because it will live on the coffee table in my sunroom for everyone to see!,237

2,I was glad to be able to get this filter via the internet. It was a cinch to install even for a 76 year old woman.,114
2,I liked the songs selected and enjoyed it very much and much cheaper than buying the tracks for download individually.,118
2,"The first sentence let's you know this is a concise, direct andimmediately accessible book which will improve your writing.The 39 ways Cheney shares are great. They help achieve greaterclarity through insight about word choices, patterns and positioning.A brilliant work which will help any writer in thewriting and rewriting process.",334
2,"This is a unique recording by one of Ireland's most exciting instrumentalists. Most of the tracks feature uillean pipes at the forefront, with a few tunes on low whistle. Arty McGlynn offers sparse but very poignant accompaniment on acoustic guitar. Some tracks feature some well placed percussion as well. The tunes are a good mix of driving dance tunes and slow airs. The style is very accessible and likely to appeal to traditional music fans as well as the uninitiated. You cannot match the power of Paddy's pipes for inspiration, meloncholy and passion.",558
2,"This episode will lead you wanting more. This is a great show. I have finished watching 2 seasons in like a week. I can't stop watching, a must see.",148

2,"When you give in and buy the product that costs around $300.00, you will get the real thing. I have watched every disc and they all work perfect. It is a lot of money, but if you want the real deal and don't want to get ripped off, than this is the version to purchase.",269
2,"This movie was amazing. The climax and the overall story was heart pound, jaw dropping amazing. I totally recommend this movie.",127
2,This CD is German Romantic organ music at its best. The skill and exictement of the playing is unmatched. The organ is a fine example of American Classic building at its best.,175
2,"I bought this album after I saw the video for ""Only Love"" (great song), and I was certainly not disappointed. Though Toni does have a richer voice, I think Trina, Tamar, and Towanda hold their own very nicely. My favorites are ""Where's the Good in Goodbye?"", ""The Boss"", ""Only Love"", ""What Does It Take""...heck! I love the whole album. Why am I trying to choose my favorite tracks? They all rock! I hope they put together another album because I'll definitely buy it!",467
2,"Montreal's Voivod were Canada's answer to Metallica and one of the titans of the thrash panteon standing along side Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax.This concept album, with it's Metal Hurlant imagery and it's shredding speedmetal, is intelligent, complex without seeming pretentious and the soundtrack to some amazing sci-fi novel never written. The album art done by Drummer Away is also worth the purchase with pictures for each song.Best tracks: tribal convictions, brain scan",477
2,"This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves cats and dogs! Hillary Price is unsurpassed in her depictions of the thoughts and actions of our four-legged friends. Her ability to express her witty observations can lift even the most dour of spirits. I received this book as a birthday present and have read it daily since. If you enjoy laughing aloud and the love of a sweet pet, this book is for you.",396
2,"Holes was the first book I read many times. I really liked the book. It was exciting to read and I loved the adventure in the book that the boys had. I would probably read it again because I have the book. I saw the movie and I liked it because I got to see what happened on the screen. There was probably things in the book that were not in the movie. I would recomend this book to kids 4th grade and up,the first time I read it was in the fourth grade.",454
2,"I love this product! I used it on my pregnant belly after showering and NO STRETCH marks. I also use it on any dry skin, scrapes, feet, and plan to use it on my baby as well. It's a pure substance, right from the shea nut tree so there are no chemicals added or any funky substances. There is no moisturizer like it!!! I am not crazy about the smell but apparently you can add essential oils to it to change the smell. Haven't tried that yet.",442
2,NoThis is an annoying feature that is total vs and should be eliminated. This is cheap and Amazon should be ashamed.,116
2,This a perfect addition to yourBible. It was once part to the Bible andgives the reader more to study and understandsome of the references to the stories it containsthat may be mentioned in other religious literature.,217
2,"I agree with the other reviewers that, while Seventh Generation does not compare to Cottonelle and other ""cotton softness"" rolls re: the softness factor, this TP is more than adequately soft. You definitely make a slight sacrifice in this area, but Seventh Generation is still better than what you get in public rest rooms . . . and, you will be doing your part to help save the environement. I am definitely not a ""tree-hugger"" type, but I feel that, at least in this area, I can make a difference with Seventh Generation.",523
2,This has always been one of my favorate albums by Neil Young. Highly underrated. Neil is back in full force with Crazy Horse after recording Hawks and Doves. Re ac tor rocks from begining to end and never misses a beat. Great to see it released in CD form now.,260
2,I thought I had accidentally thrown it out and I paniced so I bought another. Now I have one for each cat. It really gets the underhairs and is easy on the skin. It would be good for short hair dogs too.,203
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed and was enlightened by the Biblical survey, Don't Know Much about the Bible, by Kenneth C. Davis. And he consulted this Bible for most of the many Biblical excerpts he used to illustrate his points. That is what has lead me to buy this New Revised Standard Version of the Bible. Yes, I agree: the King James Version is one of the most beautifully written books in the English language. But I really need one of the NRSVs when I want to read the Bible for understanding, not for its lyric quality.",517
2,"Again, Lee Goldberg has done the deed. Written a book that you don't want to put down.",86
2,"What a great book--a ""dictionary"" of Arthurian characters and places. Very easy to use and makes getting started on research a cinch.",133
2,I wish they made more collections of Judy Garland's movies... I'm 25 years old and im a huge fan of her... I love all her 32 movies... she shines in every single one of them... amazing actress and the best singer and interpreter I have ever heard/seen in my life.must have for fans and for none fans too so they can discover how brilliant Judy Garland was!,356
2,I recieved this recording as a Christmas gift in 1999 and I must say it was one of the best gifts I recieved. I had never heard of Mr. Belew until I recieved the disk and I am an instant fan. This is a very positive recording and the power can be felt. A must have recording.,275
2,"That's the best canon lens for the money. Sharp, with nice colors and decent bokeh. My only complaint is lack of IS and sometimes inaccurate AF. But for this price you will not find a better lens.",196
2,Excellent product. Better than I expected. So easy to install even a woman can install it. :) (I did.) Quick delivery. Completely satisfied.,140
2,"Reviewer ""Giovanni"" is right on about ""All Mine."" From the moment the string section breaks out of a slightly daring close dissonance, Bennett's performance is at once both dark, crisp and confident. The arrangement has some great moments, and could have been even better, but overall a wonderful listen.Thanks to Jonathan Schwartz for exposing it on WNYC-FM.",359
2,"I found this on clearance and couldn't resist the price so I bought it. I Love it! I am cooking meals I would never have dreamed of before. Every meal turns out great. I have made steak, salmon, shrimp, and much, much more. Everything I have cooked is juicy and never overdone. The marinade cup is a great idea! My entire family loves when I cook on ""George.""",359
2,It will load you up with good info about maintaining your network and keeping it at it's best. A must for any computer guru!,124
2,"I purchased this book to use with the Tortilla pan set and it has some really amazing recipes, at least I would not have thought of, like deserts and soups. I only gave it a four, because I like photos and nutritional info in recipe books. That said, even if you don't purchase the pans, this is an inexpensive little recipe book to have handy.",344
2,Excellent boook for understanding basic accounting from the CFO of a Fortune 1000 company.,90
2,"I bought this to cut notches in some HArdie trim and Hardie panel. Even though I was cutting circles in cement board, it cut just like wood with a wood blade. Highly recommended if you need to make those pesky holes and notches in Hardie products.",247
2,"I don't think there is a product available that completely eliminates the need to shovel snow, but this product makes shoveling less back breaking. I applied Bare Ground after I shovelled my driveway and sidewalk and it helped to prevent the additional snowfall from sticking to the ground. Round 2 of shoveling went much smoother and quicker. Be careful if you are applying it when the temperature is above freezing - the sprayed area could become slippery.",458
2,"Down Home Western, Tommy Hill is a great unsung actor! I would hope that this film would have had more promotion because it is a good one.",138
2,"I must say that while neither movie is great, they are both fun popcorn flicks to enjoy on a day of lounging at home. Just watched Requiem the other day and enjoyed it more than ever.",183
2,"This is a very interesting alternate history, but it is certainly not equal to Guns of the South. Thought provoking and well researched, yet it fails to involve the reader and leaves one with a sense of missed opportunities. Overall, the book is unsatisfying and at times quite ponderous. There was a chance here for something fascinating and even wondrous. Instead it's simply interesting and rather dry. For alternate history buffs and devoted fans of the author there is no avoiding it, however.",498
2,"Ok, I'll admit it, I have a Gameboy of my own. 40-something mother of two, and I got one for myself so that I could play with my kids. They're great! We are all great Pokemon fans, which is how we got sucked into the whole Gameboy thing, and those are still our favorite games.The only drawback that I find with the thing is that it does need to be well-illuminated, otherwise you'll give yourself a migrane trying to see the tiny screen. But that aside, these babies are fun! My kids love them, I love mine, great fun all around. Go for it!",541
2,"Hi, I didn't go through all 76 responses, so hope this isn't redundant. My concern is that I don't bake a lot and wonder how the shelf life of this product compares to the traditional liquid colors. The liquid ones seem to last forever. Don't want to invest in this if it will go bad somewhat quickly. Can someone please reply?",327
2,"Definitely a definitive must for any hip hop/rap fan. Brotha Lynch Hung is my favorite artist of all-time, and his along with Season of the Siccness are his two best albums. I can not stress enough how important this cd is in my collection. I will only take time out of my day to write recommendations for 3 albums, and this is one of them. A unique beat choice and classic appearances by Lynch's crew. MUST HAVE!",413
2,i enjoy this cd a lot. buy because its worth it. it has catchy songs and has a cool sound. it is good!,102
2,"Good quality movie-making, excellent, inspiring story. Good character development and story-telling. I appreciated having an inspirational story of contemporary martyrdom.",171
2,I ordered this product because I just had a new Mohawk laminate floor installed in my kitchen and I didn't really know how to take care of it. I used a dry microfiber mop and a light misting of the floor cleaner and it did a fantastic job and took just minutes. The floor was dry enough to walk on almost immediately. I'll probably stay with this product.,355
2,"Carl Sagan has done it once again. This book is filled with eye openning photographs of the heavens, explanations of past missions thorough our solar system, and how science can prove our fears of the unknown irrational. Sagan addresses such thought provoking subjects as religion and science, the existence of life in the universe, and the dooms day asteriod. Pale Blue Dot is a must for anyone interested in the future on mankind",431
2,"This books succeeds as an introduction to Dynamics and Bifurcations. It has lot's of great pictures and examples. The authors really did a great job in that respect.Some of the theorems could be described a bit clearer, particularly the ones about Poincare-Hopf-Andronov bifurcations.",284
2,"Don't listen to the wanna be pro's, aka,equipment snobs. I mounted my Maxxum 600si with 500mm reflex lens on this tripod. I thought it was VERY sturdy.......YES !! legs fully extended. I've also had a few other tripods over the years, to compare it to. I am VERY pleased with is tripod",285
2,"Ashkenazy, Perlman and Harrell, are brilliant! I have never heard musicians play together so well, as though they all share the same mind. They are so musically sensitive and every note is perfectly executed. The music is captivating and beautiful, I never get sick of it. They capture the spirit of beethoven wonderfully. It is very inspiring to listen to these musicians perform some tricky repertoire. Hats off to all of them!",429
2,This book is excellent reading. It is based on sound biblical principles. The bible is the bestseller of all time and will remain as other books come and go. The events in the bible are happening now and will continue to happen no matter what some mens opposing opinions are.,275
2,The Brinkmann Pitmaster Deluxe barrel smoker is a great smoker... especially for the price. We use it for weekend barbeques on a regular basis... and it has held up like a champ. The offset firebox is key if you're interested using it as a smoker. Or you can convert the firebox into an additional grilling surface.The Brinkmann Pitmaster Deluxe is well worth the cost. It's a central part of every one of our bbq parties.,422

2,"My only complaint with this diaper pail is that my lid wouldn't stay closed after the first time I used it, so I just kept something set on top of the lid to keep it closed. Otherwise this pail is wonderful. Once I figured out that twisting the lid seals it shut, there hasn't been any smell, even with a full pail. I just had my 3rd baby, and I bought 2 diaper genies with my first two, and the bags would rip as soon as I used them. This has been much simpler and a LOT cheaper than the Diaper Genie.",502
2,"this is a very pretty pouch, and looks pretty well made. however, i had to take off a star because mine is a little smaller than the 6x9 listed (which i should have measured out before buying - it's definitely smaller than i was picturing in my head). also, the pockets could use more separation. my earrings will be grating against each other inside the pocket.",362
2,Just ordered today at Walmart for $219. Same item. Excited to get it!!! Looks so cute for my 2 year old,103
2,"I adore my new handbag, its lovely, huge and fabulous. I only had one little problem with the handle, the very first day that I got it, a tiny piece of it broke off, but I managed to fix it quickly and it still looks fabulous, so yes, I would still recommend this product, just be careful if you going to buy one cause its quite delicate.",338

2,The DVD arrived before the due date in new condition as advertised. I'd been wanting to see this documentary for a few years but wan't able to due to my job location. I'm very glad I bought it I learned things that I wasn't aware of about what was done to him by our government.,278
2,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas. It looks like she will have a lot of fun with it, especially because she has other vehicals that can go along the track.She really likes Dora and when I saw this I knew she would be happy with it.

2,"Though he died nearly a year ago, John Denver and his music will remain alive forever. This collection of previously unreleased music from RCA's vaults is a treasure. My favorite song on the album was ""Four Strong Winds"" a wonderful rendition of the classic. Thank you John for such a treasure. Keep them coming, RCA! --MAA28292.907271233/online-6.amazon.com--",360
2,"I watched this at my brother's house. It is a masterpiece of the genre and truly is Bill Shatner's greatest work. It will live on in this special edition.Tiffany Bolling was the perfect match for Bill in this epic. The sexual chemistry between them sizzles, especially when the spiders are in the scene. Should I be with this beautiful woman, or defeat the spiders, win her love and then be with her? Bill knows she likes him and keeps putting it off, however.",460
2,"DentaPicks are so great for cleaning between teeth (even when they had braces on them) that my dental hygenist swears I must floss several times each day. The picks have no flavor but a mint taste could be nice. I've used these things for many years but am now having a difficult time finding them. If you can find them for sale, buy several containers; I know I will.",368
2,I've already read and re-read this book 10+ times. I would've given this book more than 5 stars if there had been a choice. It's just an amazing book!!,151
2,"One of the best Sharpe books of the whole series. Honour, bravery and an over the top fort defense. Few other books in the series are so fun to read. Good Kindle edition, by the way.",182
2,This cordless phone headset by Panasonic is a great deal..Very low price & it works great.. Theres not much I can say about it except it is very comfortable to wear and the sound quality is great..,197
2,I bought one a couple years ago for my Dewalt saw. Now I bought two more to mount misc. items on. I bolted the items to a piece of plywood and then bolted this bracket to the bottom of the plywood. Works very nicely.,216
2,"I have really enjoyed Faith Food. It has strengthened my faith and is a great start to the day. I have bought over 20 copies for friends and family. Kenneth E. Hagin's simplicity in believing the Bible is so refreshing and brings me back to God's promises and His faithfulness. I highly recommend it!Tom Squashic, Pastor",320

2,I am a big fan of Enigma and am steadily collecting all the catalogue! I actually bought the digital version on iTunes - but wanted the physical CD. The music is hypnotic and trans- like - very Enigma!,201
2,"This pump kept me breastfeeding longer than I thought I could do it. Just when I was ready to give up, a nurse suggested this pump to me and it was a fantastic purchase! It hurt very badly to have my daughter nurse on my left side, so I would feed her from the right and pump the left. It's a very gentle but effective pump, I was able to express 4 ozs in about 5 minutes.Now I recommend this pump to all my girlfriends that are having babies, it really was exactly what I was looking for, the best manual pump you can find.",524
2,"American Gods by Neil Gaiman is a thrilling, thought-provoking tale of forgotten God's and their quirky existence on Earth.A long read, worth every minute, this book paints a picture of our world that is dark, delicious and delightfully wrought with deeply disturbed characters. I really enjoyed the story and writing style. Highly recommended for the dark masses.",364
2,"I used to have all of these on VHS. Now that I got them on DVD, I can enjoy them better with brighter color and better sound quality. Shipment was fast and great. No damage to the case what so ever and the DVDs never moved off the holders inside like those you get from stores.",277
2,"This book was used as a textbook in one of my college classes through Regent University. The class, ""Contemporary Problems for Christian Leaders,"" was very enlightening. The book covers world views in general and Christian world views specifically. As a Christian, my world view was transformed by this book, not in an earth-shaking way, but in a subtle way. Instead of Christianity being separate from ""the world,"" I now see Christianity as redeeming the world. I would highly recommend this book.",498
2,"This is a gift. I love it and I think that it will fit in the kitchen just fine, and I know the person I bought it for will love it.",132

2,I was very skeptical whether VH could equal the 'Everything You Want' CD. I even held back for a while not rushing to get the 'Go' item. This compilation is really good! There is not one song on here that I would not recommend! If you like the any of the great songs on the EYW CD. You should absolutely get this one! This proves the talent of VH!,347
2,"I caught this movie at a small screening a few weeks ago. It is by far, one of the better Independant Serial Killer Genre movies that has come out in the last few years.A must have for Indie-True Crimw buffs.",208
2,"I bought the DVD because I knew I enjoyed the movie. I also liked the supplemental info (with Hitchcock's daughter)--hadn't seen that before; Daughter said it was ""Hitch's"" favorite movie because in it evil is brought to a nice little town and family. Good characters, plot, and humor. Good quality DVD.",303
2,"I bought this to replace an 8X Agfaloupe I used to have for slides and negatives. Both are good. At this power some of the negatives edges are cut off, but it's easier to see facial expressions. If you need near full frame go with 8X, more detail 10X or even 15X.",263
2,"I bought this book for my mother who just loves the Jan Karon Mitford series. She is now into the 4th or 5th Dearest Dorothy book and says they are just as good. Gentle, friendly and hometowny.",193
2,I loved this DVD and wish the B5 universe could go on and on. I forgot after not seeing B5 for a very long time how attached I became to the story line and characters. JHS - more please. I'll miss Dr. Franklin and especially G'Kar.,231
2,"I found this book to be an excellent way to see the relationship of the name to the energies in the numbers. His system also helps one to see the relationship between the numbers themselves. A great book for someone already associated with the basic meanings of the numbers, and it makes for excellent party conversation.",321
2,This is a story that reminds us that there are hardships most never think about when sitting down at the dinner table. A good read.,131
2,"I used this phone for my skype call to China. The voice quality is great. It does not have many functions, however it does make fundamental communication function very well.",173
2,"If you thought Hugh Laurie was just an amazing actor, then you need to read his wonderful first (and hopefully not last) book. The Gun Seller is a suprisingly hilarious, fast-paced, page turner from beginning to end. While I am not normally one for spy novels, this book has changed my thinking on the genre. You'll immediately find yourself rooting for the main character, begging the book gods for a happy ending for this unlikely hero. Laurie's quick wit with words and insane plot twists are golden - I could not have asked for a better read.",546
2,"Many bands fal to live up to the power of their name, but not so for 'Razed in Black'. Sticking with the fast beat, heavy guitar, and barely in tune screaming vocals, this is everything you would expect from the album title. You can feel the anger in the lyrics. When this album is on, I feel the need to run fast, start riots, and kick some a**.",346
2,"I got this for my motorcycle, ATV and boat to maintain the batteries in the off seasons. It is totally automatic so you can leave it connected for days. Be sure to get the extra harnesses to put on each vehicle that has a hard to reach battery for easy plug and charge connection.",280

2,"I have read this book three or four times cover to cover. However, I go back to it frequently when I am a little down or looking for something to chuckle about. I am never disappointed. I am looking forward to the next book.I have also sent it as a gift to a couple of people who are now ardent perusers.",304
2,"this record kicks so hard and the live record is even more intimate, the live dvd is so good and the visuals are amazing",120
2,"This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the ""natural disaster"" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too",506
2,I never saw the Trees but I hope that I might one day. Having bought and liked Mark Lanegans last CD I was still hankering after Vans stratospheric guitar. This really shows what a band the Trees were - you can split them down the middle and each comes up trumps. Great guitars and Ozzy style vocals are to the fore.BTW. I saw Mark play with QOTSA and he was great..,366
2,Wow! Not sure what happened but I'm glad I bought this set when I did. I bought mine for $72 directly from Amazon.com. Now it appears that people are selling it here for $250.It's an excellent set for even non-trekkie's like myself. I grew up with these movies and with reruns of the TV show. Captain Kirk and James Bond (Roger Moore) were two of my earliest hero's in my pre-teen years.,387
2,"Describes my half breed ACD to a tee. He demands time, time, and more time but the rewards are as great as the book states. I have found a rubber ball that squeaks can keep him happy for hours fetching and running. This book has taught me training ideas I have never seen before and in just one week I can see the results.",322
2,"I was unfamiliar with Ms. Adair, but my wife's stepfather, a retired musician, gifted her with a couple of CD's, and so I discovered an impressive performer with a great sense of song selection. I have discs by jazz greats Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck, and Oscar Peterson, among others, which are not superior to Ms. Adair's take on Gershwin. If you like melodic yet jazzy tinkling on the ivories, mostly mellow but not boring, something a step up from pure pop renderings, this one's for you.",489
2,"The question of ""who's best?"" is a subjective one. My opinion after listening to all of the New Flamenco (New Age) guitarists is: They are all great and have their own distinctive styles, but Govi is king.",205
2,"Dooly's novel, ""His Brother's Castoff"" is a pleasant read and has a great cast of characters that will keep you turning pages until the very end. But be warned: reading this novel will compel you to buy up all the author's other books in this series!",250
2,"Every teeny-bopper band for kids like us has matured. They found their own style and their own type of music. N'Sync is also maturing. However, we love them more than ever.",172
2,You can also buy this book from MARDEL... it was 15.99 though. This worked great as gifts for dad and grandpa.,110
2,"Let me preface by saying that even if the movie sucked, Dafoe's performance alone would make it worth watching. He is brilliant.Anyhow, the concept of the movie is really great. A crazy director want to make the ultimate realistic vampire film... and does so by having a real vampire play an actor playing the vampire; in return for the right to eat the lead actress after filming is over.The movie itself is well done, but sometimes feels a little bogged down. The cast is strong however, and its easy to let such problems slide.",530
2,"I have been looking for this film since I saw it on the Hallmark channel. I think it a touching story, more so during these times. Am glad to be able to watch it, without commercials, whenever I want. And, it does have Jennifer Love Hewitt in a reasonably dramatic role.",270
2,"I wanted to judge for myself if this guy was as unscrupulous as others had portrayed him. He was. But what drove him? Based on his own words I think he just liked the game, the thrill of the hunt, the battle. His Marxism was simply a tool; his excuse for a chosen life. He was not driven by principle, simply lust. I say he was more an anarchist than a crusader.",362
2,This RE light unlike the first feels less like a recap in the first RE Light most of it was a recap with some scenes I don't remember but this RE Light is a must buy I don't want to ruin it for you but is you love the series buy it.,232
2,Fantastic! The original series was much better than the movies with Tom Cruise. I would recommend it to anyone who love adventure and spy movies. I am thoroughly enjoying all of these episodes.,193
2,"The Perfect Man introduces a cast of characters simultaneously realistic and fantastic. Their flaws--some serious, some deadly, some amusing--and foibles clearly resonate, and their actions and encounters--some mundane, some outrageous--are always true to character. This is an ambitious work and a must for any reader who enjoys clever plot development as well as witty, sensitive description.",394
2,I anxiously awaited Season three and was very disapointed to learn they would not be returning for Season four. What happened? That was one of my favorate programs.,164
2,"The only review of this recorder (Sony TCM-500DV) says that the recorder and appropriate adaptor ""have been discontinued."" According to Sony, neither is the case. The recorder is still available as is the appropriate Sony Worldwide AC Power Adaptor, their model number AC-E30A.",277
2,This is cheap and the right size the I wanted because I didn't want any long wires filling up near my television. Also great quality.,133
2,"As said, this movie definitely is my favorite of all time! The true story of the botched 1993 U.S. raid in Somalia that turned from a military mission to a hasty rescue operation was a very inspirational film as the pointless objective of those soldiers immediately turned into an incentive to get their brethren out of the clutches of the troubled city of Mogadishu. Ridley Scott's amazing visual attention and Jerry Bruckheimer's unstoppable action filmmaking truly account this classic as not only the best war movie ever made, but the best movie in general.",561
2,"Does anyone else have this problem? I have seen most of the David Suchet Poirot DVD's but would gladly buy those I have someone missed. My problem is that when the sets are advertised, there is no desccription of which episodes are in the set. I am therefore reluctant to order a set inasmuch as the set I order may contain most if not all of the episodes I have already seen. Does anyone else have this problem in ordering, and if so, how to you deal with it? (Sometimes I can glean the title of the episodes included from the reviews, but not always)",552
2,My Wife asked for a percolator for Christmas and so far she loves the coffee it makes. She has for gotten to unplug it a few times but seams safe enough. It is kind of hard to clean out the baked on coffee but it comes apart.,225
2,"A wonderful movie, but heads up cinemaphiles: this is the pan and scan version; it doesn't appear as if a widescreen version has been released (ever) for non-theatrical showing.",177
2,"Scott Glen shure knows how to play it cool. Steve Mc Queen cool, but in modern times. The whole movie is a different thing it has a feeling, mostly due to Glens loyality ond respect for his older partner , called ""Higbe"" in the movie. A very nice display of some more ""unknown"" actors and a great ending! Wow I just love it.",324
2,"This CD was great. All around it flowed nice with my own practice and that with my students' practices. Some songs, just so appropriate (ie: ""Remember to breathe""). It would be hear to see similar compilations by different artists.",231
2,I guess you have to be in a certain mood to listen to Tori. Its a relaxing album Tori's thought provoking lyrics and vocal stylings can be be jarring at times yet sound so delicate. The album can be summed up in one word: pretty.,229
2,"This charcoal grill is an old standard. It imparts a great smokey flavor, heat is easy to control, and cooks evenly. Over the years the quality of the metal parts has gone down. Consequently, keep it covered and out of the rain, fog, etc. and you'll get many carefree years of service. This product does require some assembly which requires very little time, simple tools, and is not a complicated. Lastly, Weber e-mails many great and free seasonal receipes, many of which have turned out to be delicious.AB",508
2,It shipped quickly and got there when expected. The problem is that the softwares manual is not very user friendly and can be confusing for 1st time users.,155
2,"Having just finished reading the book Never Let Me Go, I cannot stop thinking about the characters or the book's theme. Kazuo Ishiguro is a brilliant writer! I highly recommend this engrossing book!",198
2,"Well, I specifically bought this for Hikaru Utada's ""Passion"", although I would have liked the English version, but I like Jpop so it's just as good.In fact, it really grew on me.Yeah, the rest of the music is ripped right from the game and it's good too.So, there you have it.",277
2,The CD has excellent Sound qulaity. It has been remastered. Frankly I was l little concerned because I read other reviews that stated they went overboard with the effects. It just sounds clean and balanced to me. Plus you get previousley unreleased versions of Tush and Jailhouse rock.,285
2,The performances are unbelievable! The behind scenes show what they like to do on the road also things you've probably never known about the group. If you like matchbox 20 this video will make you love them and if you love them it's going to make you love them even more. I love it and recommend it to anyone!,309
2,"i remember the first time i heard this amazing album. it was late at night and i was listening to brent bambury on cbc's ""brave new waves"" radio show. i was completely blown away by it then as i am still am today.",213
2,"I bought these primarily to replace the dinky iPod headphones. Listening to music on these is like a whole new experience, the sound becomes so textured and nuances are more audible, plus the bass is strong but not overpowering. They fold up nicely for portability, too, although it takes a little time to get them into the case. Still a nice feature.These headphones are so good that when I broke my first pair I bought them again. Can't live without them.",457
2,"I have read a lot of complain saying that this video game is for only for rich people who can spend thousands of dollars for one amazing computer, that is false.I have a dell laptop which has 250GB hard drive, 4GB Memory, Intel Centrino Duo, 256MB graphic card (not shared) and this video game runs perfectly....Now, yes, there is 1 issue I really do not like about this video game:1. FSX does not give you a lot of airplanes like FS2004, just few ones, which make the video game BORING, for this reason, I rated it with 3 start.",529

2,My grandchildren love it. They pass them around so they can each lace everyone of them. It is very good for hand/eye coordination.,130
2,Quiet and nicely sized for small rooms or direct radiance applications. If one element burns out you will still have a good heater. Store this with a dust cover to keep the reflector clean and reduce smells. No fan to clog or wear out.,235

2,"Although I got a second hand book, it looks as good as a new book. No tear or wear on the book.This book is an amazing one. This is the best book to learn about Data Warehousing. Ralph has described using the most real time scenarios.If you are new to Data Warehousing, I say you should definitely read this book. And if you are working, then you sure must go through the individual chapters based on domains. He has explained it very beautifully!!",448
2,What an accurate album title! Beautiful relaxing selections. I highly recommend this CD if you like softer instrumental Christmas music.,136
2,Interesting concept of the dog's perspective. Makes it seem possible. Still had historical information. Easy and pleasant read. Enjoyed it.,139
2,"This movie is a brilliant scary movie spoof! It has a mystery, lots laughs, and some chills. There are some corny parts--but in a good way. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh.",203
2,"This book is hilariously funny and enjoyable to read to little kids but parents will love it too. Hank, the head of ranch security, is accompanied by his sidekick everywhere. You will get a laugh at hearing him deal with the farm cat and the coyotes and occasionally with the local birds of prey.",296
2,"I bought this for my husband and was totally excited when it came because it was way cooler than I thought. My husband loves every aspect of the watch from the big face, to the different settings for the display, and the double fastener on the very wide band. Excellent purchase!",279
2,"My best friend bought this mattress with his sofa sleeper. As I work overseas, I sleep for weeks on this mattress. It inflates in seconds and is the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. Other people simple don't believe it's an air mattress until I show them. I'm ordering one now for my new apartment overseas.The mattress is a lot cheaper from the company than from this website! And you can order just the bladder, not the whole spring system. Sounds like previous user may have had an operational error ?",519
2,"In my mind, ""Young Offender"" is about Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Narcissists (avoid them at all costs) have minds like computers, hence the computer-like and mechanical feel of the song. You leave this song feeling indifferent. Do I like it or do I not like it? That's exactly what narcissists are: indifferent. The lyrics and the music fit perfectly when thinking in this context. This song has helped me cope greatly when I determined that a good friend was indeed a narcissist. Brilliant song. Brilliant album.",521
2,"If not for anything else, the last four tracks! Oh yeah! But still the rest of the songs are freakin sweet! If you want something different in the death metal genre, perhaps laced with some Egyptian culture and myths,,,pick this bad the freakin up!",248

2,"I have used this timer for three years and it is still working. The reason I am not giving 5 stars are, firstly it's not convenient to do a Ad Hoc watering say for 20 mins one time without interrupting the programmed schedule. Secondly, since I remove it during the winter time and forgot to take the battery out (not sure if it helps though), the battery already died the next spring you use it. Have to change the battery every year.",435
2,Product was exactly as decribed!! Came in on time. Also so much cheaper than buying it from th stores!! I am very happy with this purchase!!,140
2,The Saeco Piccolo Steamer is really a good product.It's not that great on really tuff grease but it's wonderful on blasting grime out of crevices.I used it to clean out the inside of the refrigerator and it did a great job. It's great for getting into those tiny spaces that you can't clean.There's a lot you can do with this product. Smart Bargains shipping was very fast. Thanks so much.,389
2,"I took a Yoga lesson for one semester in college. The stuff in this tape is pretty similar to the one I learned beforr, such as ""Sun Solutation,"" "" Cat Pose,"" etc. So... I would say it's ok for beginners. But if you haven't done any Yoga before, you will have hard time to follow at first. Don't worry, as you practice it over and over again, you will get it and really love it. If you are looking for some authentic Yoga postures, this is the one !",449

2,"Best Neverwinter Nights Game in the series! Interesting and compelling story line. Neat character classes and skills upgrade that makes you want to keep playing to level-up. This is turn-based RPG game play in the style of D&D at its best. I would give it 5star if the software wasn't so demanding on the PC...unless u have a pretty good PC (VERY good graphics card, lots of ram - much more than the 'minimum' they say), this game will not run very smoothly or look pretty on your PC.",484

2,My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this car! She plays with it all the time. Well worth the money.,96
2,"This is a good album with a country/blues/folk mix. The songs are unique and tell stories. A few songs are a bit slow, but appropriate to the type of music. Robin makes the songs her own. This album is definitely not generic and is worth a listen.",247
2,"I make my own enchilada sauce usually, but if I'm pressed for time I go with the El Pato. For a canned sauce, it's pretty darn good.",132
2,"I am an exchange student in Japan from the US. When the Matrix came out in the US, I let it slide by. When I came over here, however, my Japanese friends were crazy waiting for the Sept. 11 opening day. I was so sorry that I did not goto see it in the states! Wonderful special effects! Even in Japan, the movie was in English... that didn't help much since I have already started to forget English!But, Mah-trix (Japanese pronuciation) is one thrill-packed, slam-blam-thank-you-ma'am, action movie! Go ahead and buy it!",520
2,"Gropius is a combination of talent from every direction required by the creation of quality music. Do not mistake the lack of guitar, and presence of violin/viola as novelty. It is seemlessly integrated with the impressive bass patterns, drums, and vocals. I would probably give the disc 5-stars if my perspective wasn't skewed after seeing them live. Buy it on your way to Dallas.",381
2,"This is a classic book that every software developer and manager should read. It explains the concepts behind the five levels of CMM. I know that might sound boring, but the author does a good job of keeping the book reasonably interesting. Most of what you read will sound like common sense, but in practice many companies do not use a lot of common sense when it comes to software development. So this book can serve as a guide to help software development organizations set realistic goals for process improvement.",517
2,Very please with how the book was shipped to me. Enjoy how Rocco uses combination of spices and ingredients to get better flavor.He has introduced me to different ingredients like greek yogurt.,193
2,"Okay, do i have to say it or can we just all agree that Twilight is a faboulous book. So what if nothing happened?! After all the nothing that draws you into the book, its SO FANTASTIC!! The chase, the sneaking and most of all the fight!!! so much fun!!! all in all i am a HUGE fan of the book twilight and if u had not read it READ IT NOW!! WHY R U STILL READING THIS!!!?? pick up Twilight!",391
2,"Perhaps overly complex. The story jumps out and grabs you. The writing is quirky, but the sentences are almost poetic. The story is great -- I sped through 420 pages, but the last 30 left me wanting a re-write. See if you can make it through the book without getting distracted by the presence of the word ""angle"" in every chapter, and the descriptions of the quality of light.I can't wait for his next one!",407

2,"OK, I admit I rented it to see only Paul Gross from ""Due South"" but I was pleasantly surprised. Peter Burg (Berg?) from ""Chicago Hope"" plays 2nd fiddle and does it well. They work well together in this ""buddy"" film, despite some holes in the plot. I'm not a skier so found the length of some of the ""extreme skiing"" sequences tedious. But the scenery is gorgeously filmed. Overall, it has more actual plot than most Sat/Sun afternoon films on the tube.",452
2,"This product will rock your boat - Bass is awesome and it has its own built in amplifier for enhancing / powering your already installed speakers. If you want a great sound system on the water, definitely get this product in conjunction with the bazooka tubules. Great value to! Most comparable subs with less power are more money",330
2,"I don't know what else to say that has not been said before. I have wanted to see this movie for quite some time and not sure why. I must say after watching the Fight Club, I found it one of the most interesting films ever. The story, camera and acting of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were excellent. True there is violence, but it was the right amount given the story. Absolutely one of the top 20 films of all time. Watch it you'll not be disappointed.",453
2,"Does anybody like poetry, or actually being able to understand what someone is talking about-perhaps you may even enjoy being able to hear the words to a song..if so, this baby is for you.",188
2,"These essays, like his fiction, are written for the reader to enjoy the language, and may be most fun for readers who've read a lot of past and current ""high"" literature. For my money, the best writing on tennis that has ever been written. His writing is to straight nonfiction and realist fiction as writing by Jarrell and Lowell (among others) is to academic poetry criticism: idiosyncratic and expressive of this particular writer's relation to words and culture.",466
2,"I am a history major and came across this woman while studying French modern history and she so intrigued me that I read her biography, which is absolutely fascinating and truly engaging. I read this book about 3 years ago but George Sand has stayed with me, though she has been dead for centuries her fiery nature has been reincarnated in her biography. If you like strong women who are true feminists without bothering with the crusade or the label this is the book/woman for you.",482
2,"I own the entire 21 books in this series, as well as all the Horatio Hornblower series. This audio book was purchased for a road-trip. Unfortunatley, I reached my destination before the book was finished. I plan to buy the additional audio books ofr future road-trips. . . .a good resaon to drive to California and back!!",321
2,"As far as textbooks go, this has to be one of the best that I have come across...and I have come across quite a few. The material is divided into closely related sections, and the text is clear and to the point in its explanation. Not much filler text or needless material. The diagrams are pretty clear and well positioned in the sections also.",345
2,"These authors have woven together a masterpiece that brings forth the importance of the new science of complexity in an understandable and practical way. They take us beyond where Margaret Wheatley invited us to ventured years ago, and support the importance of relationships as the basic unit of change. While the book is intended for business readers, it has application to therapists and anyone who is interested in genuine relationships, mutual respect and creative emergence of new ideas.",493
2,"heartbeeps is a spectacular movie. I loved it. Iam 45 years old, and every time i watch this epic i fall out of my seat laughing. I think that Andy Kaufman is the most entertaing person i have ever seen. It was sad to see him go.",229

2,I loved this book. Mrs Brenda Jackson has done it again.Please go out and get this book as soon as possible.The Westmorlands are going to be a trip.I think they are going to be five brothers that put you in the mind of Clayton Maderis. I loved the love scenes they are HOT HOT HOT!,281
2,"Mariel Hemingway gives very sound advice in the areas of food, exercise, silence and home in a clear, concise and inspiring manner. I have tried most of the recipes in this book and have found some true favorites- especially the breakfast shake and the purple puree! My favorite aspect of the book are the quick fixes and tips she has scattered throughout that offer breathing, meditation and stress relief exercises. Excellent book.",433
2,"I'll keep it short. this album is glen's best work sence Lucifuge. Although it's no Danzig II it's still damn good. Persoanly i was dissapointed with Danzig 3, 4, 5, & 6. Well this more then made up for it. Highlights include Black Mass & Angel Blake. Danzig proves once again he's still got it.",295
2,"This is British black comedy at its absolute best . It is set in an England that is sadly diminished, where the troubles in life were restricted to the perimeter of your village.Alec Guinness is masterful at playing 10 different members of the same family, male and female.Dennis price is the calm, respectable rogue that you will come to feel, is entirely justified in his murderous deeds. There are no acts of violence at all in the film which has a thought provoking twist at the end.",487
2,"This Art of Life is a must have. Bob Marley reveals The Way, The Truth and The Life. I have been anxiously awaiting the release of the Time Will Tell on DVD. Thank You for this exceptional presentation of a Legend.",214
2,"Was worried whether or not it would fit large bore trombone mouthpieces but it was perfect for my Schilke 51. Also fits Bach 1G just fine. This is meant for trombone/euphonium mouthpieces, not tuba. Simple pouch does its job.",225
2,"Very good quality and can hold my mountain bike which is quite heavy. Easily installed. Perhaps one thing that need to be considered when installing this rack is the height. It is rather high for me and mounting the bike can be quite difficult and not to mention the possible staining on the walls. Other than that, it is really good!",334
2,"I was not familiar with nina before this album. I definitley like her groove. Very powerful singer. A couple of tracks are a little hokey for my taste, but overall a great listen.",179
2,I read some of the other reviews prior to buying this. They were exactly right about the clip. It is not deep enough to be used as a clip-on. I keep it in my pocket and gym bag. It is great to see the steps I've put in. It is great feedback to my workout and weight loss efforts. It is handy to chart your progress because the unit stores your data for several days. I would definitely buy again or give as a gift.,414
2,"What can i say about the levellers..... They rule... Nuff said.This CD comes with a booklet on the uk & europe zeitgeist tour 95-96. And a craaazy hologram-type-cover-effort that makes it like you are actually at the gig if u wiggle it about in time to the music, its quite battered.14 Sweet tracks, nice version of the boatman/3friends, dijeridoo sounds xtra xcitin",366
2,"Slightly dated, jumping controls are not exactly the best, but still a must buy for anybody who owns a Genesis/Mega Drive.",122
2,"This boot was fairly competitively priced, se we got it for our seven year old. We spent a week skiing in Vermont, and it did not allow water or snow in, it kept her warm (at 8 degrees F) and she said it was comfortable.We live in Florida, but it does get in the 20's around here, so I am sure she will be wearing them here.A good boot for the money.",350
2,"This record is hot, look out for an english record coming in april 2001 self titiled from tito puente jr.",105
2,"It's comfortable, and takes up less space! We even fit it in our gazebo! I never thought my husband would sit in it, but alas, he is the one that uses it most frequently. You can sit or lie down on it. It is very strong, and so easy to put together. I actually got it up in less than 10 minutes, maybe 5. And I am not mechanical! The only complaint I have is that my head is not that comfortable when lying down. A pillow would probably help.",442
2,"This is the second GF Grill we've purchased. As we live in an apartment & gas or charcoal grills are not allowed, this electric grill is great. A breeze to clean, just wipe off with a paper towel, and easily taken apart for thorough cleaning. And it cooks quickly. A winner!",274
2,This is a GREAT book especially if you have spent as much time in Baja as I have. The recognizable history is fascinating.,122
2,"An excellent primitive resource. Provides tips and patterns for a variety of primitive projects. ""How to""s were helpful and straight forward. An excellent addition to any hooker's library!",188
2,"I love this machine but am confused as to the stitching choices. Does anyone know how to find the abcdefg listed in the panel on the front machine. The wheel that gives l.2.3.4 etc is okay but the larger wheel has no letters on it. How do I determine the different decorative stitches with no letters on the larger wheel??. I am a quilter and would appreciate all the help I can get, thanks in advance",401
2,"The Broke Diaries by Angela Nissel is a good read. Realistic situations bring back ""fond"" memories of life in college. A must read for those preparing for ""higher education!"" A smooth easy read with a lot of laughs. Enjoyed the read. A nice break for me in between scholarly journals and borish text books (Yes, I'm in grad school...)Thanks Ms. Nissel!",352
2,"This books is a colorful, fun book to read. I would any parent or grandparent to buy this books. It helps children learn their numbers",134
2,"the jeans fit beautifully, and the color was exactly what we wanted. Only problem was that the legs were a tad too baggy, but we ordered ""regular"" instead of ""slim"" fit, so we are pleased.",188
2,I'm not a huge fan of the true crime genre. But agreed to read this book after a friend could not stop talking about it. I'm glad that I did. This book is terrifying. It lets us all know that anyone can be a victim. The author succeeded in making you feel like you were there. READ THIS BOOK!,292
2,"I read the book when I was at school and later on saw the film (I am now 38). I am not at all religious, but the film has religous connertations in that it is about a preacher who steers the gangsters into believing in God and in themselves. It was very moving and really made you think about life on the street and what drugs can do to people. Erik Estrada fitted the role perfectly. Although, a little dated now, still a great film.",434
2,I purchased this book set for my brother at my boyfriends recommendation. I have not read any of the authers books. But my boyfriend said he is a good writter and this is a good series.,185
2,"The bedding set is a good quality and adorable for my little boy due 11/13. I got the border too, and it looks great up. My only concern is that I needed to get an extra valance for a large window and the dye lot doesn't match. If you think that you need extra, order it at the same time - it can always be returned.",316
2,"I had as much fun reading this as my kids did. But its not just a story, its an I spy game to. We noticed that there is one baby that is upside down on almost all the pages, can you find her? And as the babies crawl after the bees and bats they begin to follow the babies, can you find them? We had many different ages enjoying this book - 2, 4, 6, 8 & 33!The black shadow drawing lets the kids use their imagination more.",422

2,yo dis game is tough no b-ball game can beat this who kares about wat others think buy this Peace,97
2,"This was exactly what I needed to reach an out of the way outlet and it works perfectly. I suppose $12 could be seen as expensive, but it seems to be of fairly high quality materials and is definitely sturdier than the typical extension cord. I'd definitely recommend this product.",281
2,Well written and a fun read though your life will still be complete without having read this book,97
2,"I thought that this book was one of the best. It had to do with a lot of horse facts and funny parts! Stevie was great and so were all of the characters of course (except Lisa shows that she has low self asteme. Without her her friends I don't know what she'd do!). I and my two friends have a club called the Stable Club (I'm 12). We love horses just like the saddle club. And we love to read saddle club books and even the new series by Bonnie Bryant; Pine Hollow. Any way, it was a great book! Write more of those good books Bonnie bryant.",542

2,"Once I started using this oil, my Vtec started kicking really well. If your into performance I'd recommend this",111
2,After reading the reviews on this product I was unsure what type of experience I would have using this product with Linux. I'm running Ubuntu 9.10 and the touch pad worked right out of the box including the right click and scroll areas. From my usage it has been a solid touchpad that does what I wanted it to do.,313
2,This will eventually be recognized as a classic. Great story. Great acting. Great direction. Very high production values.No more needs to be said.,146
2,"Not knowing what I was getting into I had bought the first three books in the series, and I just finished Dhampir. This is an Awesome book, it tells the story from multiple view points and you love both sides. The battle sequenceing is one of the best I have ever read. This book is a buyer!",291
2,"I was excited to find this Gary, it seems he's harder to find than Spongebob. It is so cute and the perfect size for small hands.",129
2,The mouse was awkward at first but is a lot easier on your wrist once you get used to it. The center click is harder to push than most mice. The Magnifier and Instant Viewer features are nice. This mouse is more comfortable than the traditional design but there is room for improvement.,286
2,"These glasses are great, first off I got them about 3 days before I was even expecting them to arrive in the mail, then when I opened them I loved how great the chrome glasses looked. Some other reviews talked about the earpieces being short, so I was a little afraid of getting child sized glasses, but they fit perfectly. These glasses are great and a refreshing break from all those huge over-sized glasses with colored frames that every girl owns.",451
2,I love the book because it has helped me to put those dark places that have/will occur in my life in a place that makes sense and enables me to move forward.,157
2,Can't wait for Season 2 to be available on DVD or Download.The first season is high quality television.,103
2,If you enjoy the Flintstones than you will enjoy the 2nd season. I showed it at school to my 6th graders they enjoyed it. My only complaint is the audio quality is not the best on the older dvd's like this cartoon. It is fine for TV but have to turn the volume up and at school using smart board it is still hard to hear.,321
2,"At 9:30 a.m. Thanksgiving day I was bit in the face by a family dog. It was an accident, but this product was recommended by my doctor and seems to be helping with the scarring and healing.",189
2,"Pryme Specter Full Finger Gloves are not bad for bike riding but they lack any padding if you are looking for more comfort. Palm and upper Palm only have an added leather area. They are made in Pakistan. They have velcro and are tightly closed when riding. Be sure to get a larger size as they run small. In all, not bad for average bike riding.",345
2,This was a great tool to help calm our squirmy baby - who would keep himself up most of the night moving around. I read Happiest baby on the block - where swaddling was encouraged. It was magical - I didn't go anywhere without our swaddles. This particular one was easy to use and convenient.,292
2,"What I like about this book, is that it doesn't have anything like stars according to how ""difficult"" it is to solve each problem. What really matters is how beautiful it is, how it makes one surprised. If you agree with me, get this.",234
2,My first time using external flash. I works great! Multiple angle for bounce is very good. It seems I never have enough cleaning kits. Good buy.,144
2,I bought this when I ordered the Ultra Premium Lamb and Rice dog food from Natural Balance and didn't really think my dog (extremely picky) would like them. She loves them and her special treat for retrieving the morning paper and depositing it in my hand is one of these--she's a 5 year old standard Poodle and I attribute her absolutely healthy nature (never sick) to her dogfood. Try these - they are a good size and very satisfying for the dog as well.,456
2,"My sister is an aspiring filmmaker and needed a camera. As I am stuck with limited income, this camera was perfect for the price range. You'll have to buy a memory card for this, which was kind of annoying, but they are reasonably priced. It's not a high dollar camera, and generally, you get what you pay for, but this lil cam works well enough considering it's her first digital camcorder. The projects are starting already. If you want a reasonably priced digi cam for small projects or home videos, this one is perfect!",523
2,Good and comfortable. 5 star. I did not know it was with me inside. Work as it should be. Buy.,94
2,Johnny Depp gave one of his best acting performance as the Mad Hatter. He brought life to a deep charactor. Well done Mr Depp. This movie was enchanting. The special effects were well done. Alice played by Mia Wasikowski now 19 years returns to the magical world of Wonderland. By returning to wonderland she meets some of old and new charactors. This is must see for Johnny Depp fans.,385
2,"I have lived with celiac disease/ gluten intolerance for 24 years and tried an uncountable number of Gluten free products. This is the one I love best for every type of cooking and baking. I love the large size. With 2 Gluten Intolerant people in our family, and 4 non GI members who prefer this baking mix to wheat baking mixes, we go through a bag every few days. It is pretty much an equal substitution for flour measurements so no calculating necessary. The nut adds great texture, moisture and flavor.",506
2,"This cologne is the Sex Panther of Anchorman. It is absolutely incredible. It has a somewhat stinging first scent, but quickly fades into a rich mix of lavender and masculinity. As with all cologne, you should definitely find it in a store (Macy's or Dilliard's) and try it before you buy it, but you really need to try this.",325
2,"I love this leather chain~ it comes in different lengths and in brown, too. It looks great with big silver pendants and my turquoise pendants. They look great layered too~ just be very careful with the catch on it however, I've found it can break pretty easily. A stronger catch would be excellent but if you are careful with it, it's no problem. Great price for the value!",373
2,Video Game arrived in excellent condition and quality. Video Game arrived in a very timely fashion.,99
2,This must surely be one of the most incredible pieces of art ever. With glimses into the human mind so profound that it changes the way you must look at yourself and the world around you. Truly amazing,201
2,I have a friend at school and she says I needed a new hairstyle. I went straight to Digi Makeover and now I'm brand new. What's also neat is you can do your friends in Photo Booth Mode! This toy won't let you down and I also recommend Nintendogs!~Enjoy~,253
2,"WOW - just bought this DVD based on the Amazon reviews and I was impressed. She focuses on fast, practical foods for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and I thought everything looked good AND made me believe I could also do it, which is important. I wish she'd get a show on the Food Network.",288
2,my grand daughter loves dorothy.. this is a great set.. would recommend it to any one.. love it for children..,110
2,"I just brought this bomb cd, feeling badly that didnt get it when it came out. I put it in my system and her music was extraordinary. She is one of the most talented musicians out there. Writes, produces, arranges, composes the piano melodies in ALL her song--come on now! She combines soul, R&B, classical, and hip hop in her incredible album. Yo, everybody, go pick this up.",376
2,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a exciting book continuing as number five in J.K Rowlings story. This book was so good that I could not put it down, In fact as crazy as this may seem i managed to read the whole 896 page book in one day-saturday the 22! I loved the new relationships in this book such as Harry and Cho Chang's. There is so much meaning in this book! A sad ending though. I cried just as Rowling did as well. I feel like the character was a part of me-in fact the character was my favorite too.",522
2,"Reading about James Cagney written by himself was the best way to understand Mr. Cagney. I enjoyed his anecdotes, incidences and thoughts throughout the entire book. I appreciated this actor's wide range of acting from gangters to song & dance man. Truly an enjoyable journey into this very fascinating humble man's life. This book is written as though James was speaking right to you--having a conversation with you. Most enjoyable!",433
2,"Just wanted to say that I loved the novel. I'm just now getting into reading, but reading this novel has made me want to continue to read and search for talent as great as Tracy. It was amazing and like Tracy said, it's not a book on a one woman experience but many. I didn't only see myself in many of these parts, but also family and friends. This book made me Laugh, Cry, and in several parts Seize the moment.:) I must say Tracy is one TALENTED SISTA!",455
2,"good photography and good quility movie. I enjoyed it before, decide to have it in my album archive. I reccomended for general public",133
2,"I was afraid to put the book down. And the moment in the book where she jumped out of the window, my heart stopped. I'm like, no no this book should have a happy ending!! But anyway I would recommend this book to heartwarming lovers and thrill seekers.",252
2,Ive been using Brita for years and their product functions pretty well. The only issue is the packing. The filters are placed and packed in a messy way so that it looks like used-filters.....,191
2,"Mos Def's music is an example of where Hip-Hop should be heading. I have battled the options of settling for music that disrespects and exploits my womahood and my people, waiting for artists like Mos Def, Common, the Roots, Dead Prez and De La Soul to blow up. It just isn't happening quick enough. If you still have faith in Hip-hop, and you don't have this album, catch up to speed and support those that truly represent this culture.",437
2,"At last, a real woman emerges who is Eleanor Roosevelt. She's been so idolized or hated for so long that it's refreshing to have a real human being written about with real understanding and compassion. Not only does the real Mrs. Roosevelt emerge from the past, but so does the real story of what the depression years were like. Not just selling apples on the street and soup lines, but a dynamic, serious time when we as a nation nearly lost our way. A must read.",464
2,"there is more to this game than a lot of PC role-playing games i've played. all that in the palm of your hand LOL, if you don't have it BUY it",142
2,This was the best book I have ever read. Finding out both mine and my husband's love lanuages has been great. Everything was easy to follow and made so much sense. It has improved our marriage a ton and I think that every couple married or not should read this book. It was wonderful!!,285
2,"I finished reading this books in 2 days only! Wow!!! I really really love it! Excellent story, great characters and plot. I love the wolves too. This is one of the best story I ever read, the one that you cannot put down before you finish it. I even stay up until 5:30 am. My mind keep telling me to read one more chapter. just one more, and I ended up with lots more. This is one of those books that one MUST have! truly a masterpiece. I can't wait to read the sequel.",469
2,"I bought a Leapster for my 3 1/2 year old daughter, because she always wants to play with her 6 yo brothers gameboy. She absolutely loves it. The only toy that can hold her attention for literally an hour. The downside is that once her brother saw it, he couldn't put it down. Bummer for her. We bought him one the very next day, and now it is pure heaven in our house. It is by far their most favorite toy!!! It is also very educational, so you don't have to feel guilty about them playing video games!!! Awesome job once again LeapFrog!!!",540
2,"I liked reading Dirty Diamonds because it's a book that'll keep you up and going until it's finished. I read it in one day; I just couldn't stop reading, kept on wondering ""what's coming next?"" Betty Sullivan La Pierre has written a book with a good story line and this with a few unexpected happenings here and there... Dirty Diamonds is the 4th book in the Hawkman series and I can recommend it to everyone who loves to read a thrilling story!- reviewed by Sylvie for Euro-Reviews",482
2,yes another amazing album by supertramp forsure but a great album gets a million times better with the amazingness that is fools overture. This song is underrated by both fans and the public through it's there best song a posibley one of the best ever it doesn't make it anywhere on there best of really sad it's such a beautiful song running close to 11 min it's great,369
2,Good product for the price. A little thinnner material than I had hoped but for the price you can't go wrong. A bit stretchy so it fits very well.,146
2,"If you look at the title ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" and think ""That's silly. I won't like it,"" then you won't. If you look at that title and think ""F*#$ yes I want dinosaurs on a spaceship. And throw in some Egyptians,"" then you will. As a bonus, Mitchell and Webb!",265
2,My husband asked me to get this for him while he was deployed. He was glad to get it and it was exactly what he was expecting. Nice size. Not too big and not too small. He has never had a problem with camelbak products.,219

2,"This is one of my favorite books and I had preordered the movie after i saw it in theaters. And a few days after it came out on sale I already had the dvd. Amazon's delivery's are fast and very reliable, and I was able to track my order",236
2,"Way worth the $9.99 price...fairly simple to play, but good graphics and different courses keep you challenged. Best feature is wireless head to head function -- best when both of you have the game as you can play lots more courses and have more options. But overall this is a fun golf game worth hours and hours of game play.",326

2,"I was excited after I received my shipment and hurried up to set it up in just minutes! As a freelance photographer, I get many requests for still life photography, but sometimes I run into problems like bad lighting, background, etc. This little studio solved my problem! The only draw back: the lights heat up REALLY fast! You have to shut them down every 10 minutes or so, or you will start smelling things!",410
2,This is a great TV series-some of the props remind me of when I was growing up in the 50's. Characters are well-developed and convincing.,137

2,I bought these for my boyfriend. Luckily he liked them! He finds them to be very comfortable and well built. The downside he keeps them on when he comes home instead of leaving the by the door and now I tend to vacuum a lot more because he is tracking debris everywhere.,270
2,"This book is a text for a class I am currently taking. While it covers all the basics, even the classics yet it also reflects how the cooking is today. The recipes come from a wide variety of sources and not just the school's own files.",236
2,"This is one of the very best adaptations of Alice. The cast is wonderful, the music is great, and there is a good dose of darkness around each corner in this movie. It does not pander to the audience like the more watered down Disney version, but has a good balance of humor and horror.Great movie overall, one of the best!!!",325
2,"This is the music for lost souls. It's Fantastic, amazing and outstanding Sandra's voice on this album. If you like pop music or not this sound is especially made for you. They said five stars. I say all the stars in the Universe!",230
2,"I uses this book almost every day. Each page has pictures in full color of every North American Bird (930 in all) with a complete discription of the bird, its song, behavior, breeding, nesting & population. This book also shows the rang of each bird from summer/winter residents to where the birds can be found year-round. The price is right and the book is big 10 1/4"" X 8"" and weighs at least 7 pounds.This is a great buy if you want a book that will meet most of your needs when it comes to North American Birds.Richard",522
2,"This ""Coffee Table"" book successfully traces the history and development of Irish Architecture. Co-authored by the president of the Irish Georgian Society, ( Who also photographs many of the houses & castles in this book) it supports the view that Ireland produced great architects and great buildings. It is a wonderful photographic and historic record.",354
2,"This book is short but gives a lot of info on how the bsb started out. The book gives info on each band member. It is an excellent book if you want to know all about your fav bsb member. The only problem is it is an old book and the ages are wrong, but who cares about the ages of five totally hot guys, if you are a true fan you know the recent ages of each member.(The pics are so cute!)",389
2,I bought this for my son when he was a newborn. He was not a small baby at 7lbs 13 oz but he fit in his infant carseat with this without any problem. He never had the head bobbing problems that my daughter did when she was in her infant car seat. The only downside I saw to this was that my son was a May baby and he would get a little too warm in the summer with this. I also think that this would be a great thing to have if you weren't going to use an infant seat and just started with a convertible seat. At $20 I think it was a great product.,547
2,"This is a good CD, for the most part. Thin Lizzy was not a band with many media hits, but that does not mean that they were not a great band, because they were. ""The boys are back in town"" ""Jailbreak"" ""Dancin' in the moonlight (It's caught me in its spotlight"" ""Still in love with you"" ""Whiskey in the jar"" and ""She knows"" are the six songs that really stand out.",363
2,My 9 year old son wanted this for Christmas. Of course we all enjoyed watching this classic. Now we can watch anytime we want.,126
2,"I was fortunate enough to work the club these guys came out of, and got to see them play live. Bill Mattson's vocals are the highlight of this CD with some good to great songs to back him up. The CD is definitely on the bluesy rock side with songs like Mississippi and Fourwinds. To be honest these two songs alone are worth the price of the CD. Good stuff!",357
2,"Looking at some of the 1 star reviews, I was a bit reluctant to order this and tried it as soon as I opened the package. I am on a diet and so far had to punch 3 extra holes on each of my belts. This one, when used, on a wood base, punches verey professional holes with no effort. Two hammer strikes and there you go. Love it.",326
2,"When I explained the plot to my son he said - ""oh, Men in Black, but dinosaurs"" - they are among us and Garcia makes it work!Don't try to read this book on public transportation, you will be laughing so hard that everyone will want to know what you are reading and the concept is so hard to believe that you may be shunned.",323

2,I received a sega genisis 8 years ago and the graphics are not great but you have alot of fun on the game. I just wish they still made games for it especially car games when I received sega genisis I thought it was going to be a cheap system that would break in three days but it has lasted a long time but I just hoped they would continue to make games for sega genisis.Thanks,377
2,I like Woodrow and his style and specificity on topics he chooses to write on. Each element is written short sweet and right on target. In looking at various prophecy authors his stands out as informative and seems to follow scripture very well.,245

2,"I was given this book as a child, I don't remember how old I was...I just remember this turned into my favorite book. I still have it on my shelf today (I'm 33 with no children yet) and occassionally pick it up to read it.Such a great story to remind us all about respect for others and that looks aren't everything when you have kindness in your heart.I highly reccommend reading this even if you are an adult.

2,"My 5 year old daughter and I loved this movie. The characters were well written and as usual, Disney is great about adding some adult humor to keep it interesting. One word of caution - I was glad that I did not bring my younger daughter, as I believe some of the bear attack scenes may be scary for children under 4.",317
2,this is him's greatest song ever!the greatest song ever made!i can't describe it!download it on singingfish.com for free and realize its moving power!,150
2,"I enjoyed this movie alot because of the ""irony"". The guy is a Mormon (These people are supposed to frown at stuff like that[Porno]) But he just wanted to offer his wife the best and he tried it then the movie was a big hit, something he hated and his wife found out. The story was good, so was the ending.",306
2,It you are a fan of Warehouse-13 you cannot on pass on Season 3 loaded with extras including the blooper reel. The interviews are really fun. The cast appears to really enjoy each other and working with each other. If I have 1 complaint it that it's only available on DVD and not High Definition Blu-ray so after reading this purchase it.,338
2,"This lasted two summers until the squirrels figured out that gnawing the plastic seed catcher on the bottom would cause all the seeds to fall out. The good part about this is that it kept the squirrels intrigued long enough for me to be able to shoot them. This definitely prevented repetition, one squirrel at a time.",318

2,"A priest gave me an earlier version of this book years ago. I have subsequently purchased many for students in a theology seminar that I have mentored for twelve years. The book is divided into chapters that work perfectly as a week's assignment for any bible study group. Each chapter includes artwork, poems or hymns, biblical passages, and essays on various aspects of prayer. This book is truly a spiritual delight.",419

2,Future MD is probably the best medical school admissions book I've read. I really liked that medical students wrote it and it answered a lot of my questions. I strongly recommend this book to anyone wanting to go to medical school.,231
2,This movie touched me so much!! It is about so much more than just lesbian sex. The story and the acting was excellent. Piper Perabo's acting was superb. I absolutely felt her pain and rage in this movie. Anyone who has been in love will feel her pain. This tearjerker is definitely a welcome addition to my movie collection.,325

2,"Recently I found myself at London's Heathrow Airport facing a 3-hour layover. Couldn't have been a better time to begin reading ""Tick Tock."" Hours ticked away like minutes as I became drawn into the drama, humor and suspense of the characters' lives. Gail Ramsey does an excellent job at mixing plot and sub-plot in a way that enhances the book's entertainment value, all the while keeping the reader glued to the pages. Well Done!",431
2,I love these jeans!! The fit is fantastic and they are very comfortable. It would be very helpful if they were available in a petite length so I didn't have to hem them. I just bought another pair. They are really hard to get and this is the first time they have been available since I bought the first pair in April. I wanted to get two pair but only one was available.,370
2,It's great for computer maintenance. The ability to blow air is one of the things I like the most; but the extra attachments have the ideal size for dealing with dusty small electronics. The price is just right in my opinion.,225

It has such a lovely smell that lasts all day You don't have to use a lot, just a couple of drops right when you get out of the shower or just pour it in the bath for a clean scent and soft skin. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Neutrogena products.",312
2,"I first heard Gunnar Madsen on Sex and the City. I couldn't figure out what song it was, but I would play it over and over with Carrie's voice over and everything. Then I figured out it was ""Anna"" and a moment later bought this CD. It is better than I expected, only having heard ""Anna."" I play this CD all the time. It is perfect for when I'm reading, driving, cooking, doing anything. It's fabulous!",401

Wonderful set of cast and I couldn't help but love each and everyone especially those cute F4 boys and of course Jandi. I cant wait to get Box 2! And just watch the show through over n over again!",366
2,I loved th?s book. Spencer wr?tes beaut?ful clean sentences w?th just the r?ght amount of ?magery.

2,"upside: i usually dont go for the supernatural/horror genre, but this book hooked me. i was studying at borders and someone left this book at the table i was sitting at. read the back cover and the rest is history. im a sucker for these ""survival"" stories, man vs _________________. in this case, its vampires and matheson breaks it down to a science.downside: theres a collection of short stories written by matheson that disappoints following the conclusion of this book. after enjoying ""i am legend"" so much, it was such a letdown.highly recommended to all.",560
2,"I remember seeing this at the pictures (having bunked in, because I was too young).I thought it was very funny at the time and that Gabrielle Drake was stunning.Well, that sort of 'Mind Your Language' come 'Adventures of ...' humour has dated beyond recollection of anything amusing.But it was well worth the dosh just to see Gabrielle Drake in all her glory again.",365
2,"The writing on this series is phenominal. The dialogue is smart and believable. The characters are so morally flawed, yet I continue to root for them. Walt's moral compass is second to his ""do what needs to be done to succeed"" and this is one of the fascinating aspects of the show. I am sure psychiatrists fans are have a field day watching it.",345
2,"These shoes are light and comfortable to wear for a long day of work / walk. The lambskin lining is especially nice on your feet, initially. Priced at $50ish, the shoes are affordable. However, after 2 months of ~2 days per week, the cushion beneath the lambskin lining looses its ""lift."" Along with the proletarian finish, these shoes are perfect for a day out in the field, not in a business setting. One should not pay more than $50 for this pair.",450
2,"I bought this book as a read aloud for my six year old and yes, she loved it. The illustrations and hand written notes from Cinderella to her dead mother added a degree of postmodern hilarity perfect for a smart nine to twelve year old and for me as well. This book makes a great gift.",285
2,"This album is like a seedless watermellon.It's really good.What more can you say about The Strokes, except that they are the best band out there.With Julians smooth vocals, fabs expert drumming,Nick and Alberts guitar solos and Nikolai on bass supporting the songs from behind,""Is This It"" is the best CD evre made.If you don't have it, make sure to pick it up.",361
2,"I like very much the voice of KD LANG so I like this CD. Best song: Lock, Stock And Teardrops!!! It is awesome!!If you like country music you will enjoy it. Even when I like the whole CD maybe some songs can be weird for other people. No matter what I just love it. She have a great great voice!!!",297

2,"It's a radio wild man, yelling, howlin' jumping up and down and playing the wildest hottest hits. It's Wolfman Jack. Crazy phone calls, nutty jokes and that darn wolf howling. It's radio when radio was exciting, fresh and entertaining. That's the ""howlin on the air"" CD in a nut shell. Great sound quality, great oldies and lots of great memories. Google Wolfman Jack for great websites that have interesting facts about the Wolf.",430

2,"This is a fantastic souvenir of the Heaven and Hell 2007 Tour. I saw the Dallas show from about 10 feet in front of the great Tony Iommi. This is the only ""Sabbath"" I have ever seen. It is also my favorite incarnation of the band.This tour transalted very well to video. The sound and video quality is superb. The only concert DVD that beats this, in my opinion, is the Whitesenake - Live in the Still of the Night DVD.If you were there, get this. If you weren't, this will fill you in perfectly on what you missed.The extra interviews are excellent!",550
2,We LOVE the Kidz Bop CD's. They're run and a great way to pass the time in the bath or dancing around for the kids. THey're fun and allow the kids to sing a long. Just GREAT.,174
2,"Schoenberg is willing to reconsider and rethink every aspect of traditional music theory. It's too bad his conclusions are almost invariably wrong, but this book will help you reconsider and rethink traditional music theory yourself--and come to your own conclusions. Also: this is much too unwieldy for the classroom; use Robert Ottman's texts instead. I recommend as well PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns--for theory and for practice.",465
2,"Marc Anthony's Album El Cantante is good when you see it as it is;; the soundrack of a movie in which he was playing and singing the part as Hector Lavoe. Of course that if you compare the songs on the soundrack with the originals songs Marc's performance will not be good. But what are we really talking about here: about his singing skills and talents as a salsa singer, which are SUPERB! or about the imitiation of Hector Lavoe?Talking of both he really hit the mark!!",471
2,"Since my weimaraner can chomp through anything, this has stood the deal thus far. My only complaint that I have about this product has nothing to do with the product. It has to do with me...

Will buy more Kong EXTREME products in the future!",418
2,"The Brepohl's book surely is the best book about the theory of the jewelry's affair's that I know, but isn't a project book. Is a textbook well written, with a very good english translation (the original is in german).The theory of metalurgy, that is lacking in the others books on the field, is update and well presented.In the end of some chapters there are few examples of student work, but their level is very high, and isn't showed all details of how to get it.

2,"""I paralyze"" is my favorite song, and it's Cher's too! The song is amazing, but the rest of the album is pretty boring. Try to find an import single somewhere, and if there isn't one, buy this cd, it'll probably be cheaper anyway.",230

I enjoy bringing it out periodically so that whomever is visiting me will inevitably ask, ""Who is that?"". This is a fantastic jazz performance by an artist who really did not produce too many solo albums. You will be pleasantly surprised if you ever have the good fortune to hear this one.",455

2,not only a mans book but a womens book. the book pulls at your heart strings. the trails and tribulations of milts life on the field and off the field. and what the players had to go through that era and how they paved the way for the players of today to reap the benefits that they recieve today.the players of today dont give a dam about old ballplayers and what milt and the ballplayers did for them. all they care is about themselves. would be an excellent movie.,467
2,This product fit the bill when I wanted to get a zune docabale sound system. I was a little concerned about sound quality but in the end this system really surprised me. I used it during my new years party and some people were trying to figure out where the extra speakers were placed. It filled the room nicely with sound.,323

2,"I found this book, despite it being out of print, through a third party vendor serviced by Amazon. Finding it was worth the effort since it is an extremely useful supplement to The Journey from Abandonment to Healing.

This book fills out the details and the exercises discussed in The Journey... book and together the two books provide an essential package to aid recovery.",465

2,"This is a decent 2 way radio.Pros:Works wellGood sound qualitySturdy (dropped mine several times and they still work great)They will last (had mine for probably over 5 years)Cons:On the bulky sideA bit expensiveShorter rangeBottom line:I was at Target today and saw Motorola's radio, don't remember what it is but it has a 4 mile range, is tiny, and was only $17.99. I would go with something more along those lines. The FR60 is a good radio, but you can get better for cheaper.",478

2,"As an older returning non-traditional student,for me, this book really answered the questions you don't even think to ask but should. It really helps overcome a lot of anxiety for returning students, especially on Math.It also gives you an excellent game plan to follow on studying,and life management for those married students or single parents returning to school. It's worth the small investment. It is well written by someone thats been there.",448

Although I didn't have many negative effects, due to me eating right and following the, I noticed some times when I splurged just a little(popcorn) it had horrible results. Unlike many,I never pooped on my self but it did make me want to use the bathroom really bad or would hurt my tummy if i didn't.",450
2,I was not sure I would care for this book when I bought it but boy was I wrong. I loved the setting and the characters. I am from southwest Florida so I know very little about life in the panhandle area of the state so that for me was interesting. I also found the archaeology aspect very cool. I am glad to have discovered a new series!,337
2,i finished this book last night and cried. my son asked me what was wrong. but everything was right. that's what you get with a good book. things can make you cry and be right and be good. i tried to read another book the same night as i have several waiting for me...but it felt like cheating...i needed to spend more time with the memories and the people engaged still with me...this is one of those books. things shall remain.,429
2,wonderful acting and a good review of some of the historical events of the time...great drama and the other seasons are wonderful too!,134
2,"Ordered online concerned what exactly would arrive. The product is flexible but strong enough to not be damaged by wood fragments. Has not torn with movement or stretching. You can see material as it passes but I would not say its ""clear"".

2,"Waooo... wonderful movie. I am very romantic and will a dream come true if I find love like this. Very well written, just beautiful.",132
2,"the reason i love Zep so much is the variety of styles they incorporate into their music, which is won of their most heralded traits. Not one of these songs sounds the same, which is what makes it so great. My favs are The Rain Song, The Crunge, Dancin Days, D'yer M'ker, and the Ocean. Oh shoot, that's the entire CD, and i origionally bought the CD b/c of Over the Hills and Far Away. Some may dislike other songs and favor others, b/c of their individual taste buds and the endless variety of flavors on this CD",514
2,"This record is a perfect introduction to the work of Bruce Cockburn. The CD sleeve note gives credit to the writing of Charles Williams for the inspiration of some of the songs, and is probably the reason that the lyrics have a poetic and dreamlike quality. The music on the record compliments the songs perfectly, with some excellent guitar playing by Bruce.I can highly recommend this recording and have played it many times over the years.",442
2,"I was surprised at how useful this book is. When I first looked at it, I thought the questions looked obvious and simplistic, but they work very well to start off team meeting sessions. The authors provide lots of good ideas about how to use them, and little anecdotes to inspire you to believe that the questions can actually change the way you do business. I've used them for meeting kick-offs and to jump-start moribund discussions.",435
2,This is the best Mp3 player you could get at this price. Not only can you play any Mp3's but you can play Mp3's that are write protected. I bought two of these as a gift for my brothers and they absolutely love it! The device is as small or smaller than a pack of gum. I recommend this to anyone.,296
2,"I think these taste pretty good. There are lots of nuts & and a few raisins in these slightly bigger than bite sized cookies. You get 54 cookies for the price, so it is sort of pricey but they use quality ingredients so it is probably worth it.",244
2,"I love this chopper. On some food items I make or cook, I want my onions or garlic finely chopped and this does the trick. I have a few relatives that won't eat something if it has onions in it, but with this mini chopper, they can't see the onions but the flavor is there. Would recommend to anyone.",300
2,"The Hornblower series is absolutely the best of its kind. Dewey Lambdin is fun and Obrien os OK, but the late C S Forester has provided me with pleasure since I was a kid. I couldn't pick a favorite. Lord Hornblower certainly does not lower the standard.",254
2,Every child has had an occasion in their life where they have felt different. The ability of one gold cat in a sea of black cats is able to change the outlook of everyone she lives with. If only real life were as adaptable to change. This is a fun book which also delivers a very gentle message. I would highly recommend it.,324
2,"This is not just another one of Grisham's novels, this is packed with stay up all night suspense and mystery that'll have you biting your fingernails. This is one of Grisham's best!",181
2,"I was Very happy with the Blu-Ray, no matter how many times I watch this film it never fails to deliver. Very well done and they picked the perfect actors to play the roles. It was nice seeing it in crisp HD, it for sure cleaned up very well.",242
2,"I love this. It gives me that extra little boost while working out. It makes me sweat more and helps me lose weight a bit faster. It isn't a miracle or overnight fix, it's just a nice assistant.",194
2,"Picked up a used jointer and purchased this as an upgrade. I was a little time consuming to install, and I recommend purchasing a new set of bearings to avoid having to remove them from the old cutterhead. The Shelix is well-designed and well-packed. Cut quality is excellent, and noise is markedly reduced. I am very pleased! Tips: make sure you torque each cutter to the recommended 50 in-lb to improve cut quality.",417
2,Got this for my older dog who has a problem with getting her ears dirty. I used a few pads on each ear and they seemed to clean out all the nasty gunk.,151
2,"I bought these for my husband to wear as PJs. They are very good quality and very very soft unlike some cheap ""silk"" boxers you find in the store. So far they have held up to repeated washings and have maintained their color.",225

2,"Having just readPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Too,I was keen to read this book to keep the momentum going . I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by Brian Tracy is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read the book, constantly refer to it, or listen to the Cd's. This is truly a resource to be used ov. I highly recommend this book.",431
2,"This is a nice book for film lovers. Ebert answers all types of questions from his readers. These questions range from script development to film review to questions about individual actors and directors. Of course, Ebert infuses his trademark wit and humor throughout the book. Sample question: How many scripts that get purchased by movie studios are actually made into real movies?",384
2,"It is important to note that this book is written by a Frenchman, but one who is very sympathetic to the US. It is written in an academic style, and at times assumes a knowledge of French history and culture that may be lacking in the American reader. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating study of the subject, particularly the first bits concerning French attitudes during the 18th century about North America's degenerative qualities, and the French sympathy for the Confederacy. Some of the later bits were a bit drawn out, but all in all, very interesting.",557
2,"if you like sci-fi movies from the 80's this movie will work for you. sure it is a lot like the movie battle beyond the stars but so what! i just pretend it happens in the same universe. kind of like a side-quel. its fun and the kid is'nt too annoying, the scenes on the station are cool. besides hawk has a hero quality thats hard not to like. kinda like ice pirates meets battle beyond the stars. kids will like this film.",424
2,My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much. It goes pretty close to the Biblical stories.It is such a wonderful story that kids and adults will enjoy. Glad we saw this one.,172
2,"I received this book as a gift, and carry it in my purse for quick reference. The games have entertained my 4-year-old daughter--and me!--at the doctor's office, in restaurants, in the grocery store, and in the car.The games are easy, fun, and much more creative than anything I could come up with on my own. (And it sure beats the whining.)",341
2,Nothing really to say except Fred never disappoints. I love him and his music always reflects time spent with the Father! Buy this cd...you won't be disappointed.,162
2,"Sure, the action sequences aren't what they are in today's Bond films, but this still has the same cool factor which makes this series great.",141
2,Jerry Lee sounds as good as ever. One of his best works to date. Great addition to my music library,99
2,"Though ""Healing Journey"" isn't available on CD at Amazon, you can buy it from Dr Miller's own website. Amazon's rules prohibit me from giving the URL, but if you Google ""Emmett Miller"" you won't have any trouble finding it.I've listened to this tape repeatedly and always enjoy it. Sometimes it puts me to sleep, which is even better.",334
2,I would recommend this. I bought it for my husband and it has already outlasted his last one and is holding up well.,116
2,This is great product for people who loosing hair or on the medical process. This would retain the confidence as you are in good sharp. Highly recommend !!,155
2,I love the cd..it includes dialoge from the actual movie which was very funny. all the songs were great..im a big 80s music fan so if you like 80s then this soundtrack is great for you.,185
2,I got and enjoyed this movie several years ago in the old VHS format. Needless to say the DVD format is so much better. Several good reviews have already been written on all aspects of the movie and I won't do a repeat.I wanted to own this movie because it was the last great performance of two of Hollywood's legendary western stars. Having it in on DVD just improves my enjoyment.,382
2,"As the editorial reviewer stated, this is indeed a first rate biography. It only lacks good map which is something hard to understand considering the subject. However, don't let this put you off; find an atlas with a map of central Asia and enjoy.",247
2,"I loved the songs from the film, but I could do without some of the interpretations. If you're a South Park fan, by all means, buy this CD! I didn't care much for the rap stuff, but the rest was pretty hilarious.",212
2,"It's a practical guide on defining service characteristics and design principles in multiple levels, from component implementation to application design to enterprise architecture. Very digestive material.",205
2,"Best protein and value I have seen. No added sugars. And no added artificial sugars, which is a big deal!! And difficult to find. Aspartame and Sucralose are so crappy for you, why would you work out and then feed your body that junk? The same goes for fructose or other flavorings and sweeteners. None of those chemicals here! It's great to find a healthy protein.",365
2,"A quality ""Tee"". I have worn and washed the tee several times with no noticeable shrinkage or fading. It's a low cost quality tee.",130
2,"When I first read the excerpt for BELOVED WARRIOR I wondered if the book would live up to my high expectations -- and it sure did! Like Jennifer, I fell in love with Dar and his little dragon. A creative, funny, non stop romantic fantasy adventure. Ms. Di Canio is definitely an author to watch for. Bring on the sequels! *G*",325
2,"this take care of the re-model home and my floor molding, and almost all of Chair molding too for 1000 this is sure shot.",121
2,I got this as a christmas gift and was amazed at the game quality. The graphics are awesome. My dad walked into the room on Christmas while i was playing and asked if my home team was playing. If you dont look closely you may think its an actual hockey game on ESPN.,266
2,"This movie was great. My wife even liked it, and she doesn't usually like my action movies.",91
2,"This game is excellent for children, educational and fun. The game is simplistic in that it offers straight up learning, without the frills of graphic laden game that detours more towards entertainment, than the basics. My kids choose this foremost over the contemporary learning systems, and they excel.",304
2,just another great BBC series! watched all 4 seasons and loved every one of them. brendan coyle is a great actor,112
2,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about an industrious and quite eccentric lady who lived into her 90's. I always thought of Miss Tudor as the illustrator off children's books and had no idea that she lived a life dedicated to creating her own world. I was amazed at how hard she worked to sustain her unusual lifestyle. it inspired me to learn more about her and her children so I did an Internet search which surprised me even more. I loved the illustrations. I am inclined to look for a biography about her that was not approved by her.,544
2,The maps helped us follow the right route and identify all the towns along the route. We're eager to use them all.,114
2,"I found ""Sailing By Grace"" to be very inspiring! Not only is this book a collection of wonderfully written poems, but the author has taken the time to include a Biblical truth that applies to each of his poems. His opening comments challenge the reader and put the poem in context to be enjoyed to its fullest. Truly a work of art from a man who loves his Lord, his family, his church and those whom he has had the privilege of impacting! I highly recommend this book!",468
2,"My son received this for Christmas, he's only 3 years old and loves it. He's getting great at the mazes and loves mixing colors. This is a great addition to his leapster game collection and money well spent.",207
2,I LOVE this camera! It is very easy to use and has LOTS of great features! It takes great pictures!,99
2,Fantastic game but the controles are preset and can not be reconfigured.I am used to configuring the controles a certain way and could not get used to this setup.I guess it is like the old saying ( You can't teach an old dog new tricks )I am a gamer and this is the first time I have seen this.Hope this is not the way of the future in games.But SIERRA comes up with a lot of weird stuff.,388
2,"Nice product, a bit difficult to manage for multiple mixes but serves the purpose for us well.",94
2,Amazing viewing. American history from the Native people's perspective is absolutely heartbreaking.Thank you Amazon for making this DVD set available to us Aussies.,164
2,"Hey what can I say that you don't already know...It sounds like Creed (hey, there's a shocker) which is pleasent. Always a positive message and a catchy sound, but not a great deal of diversity...Can't blame them though, when ya find something that works, stick with it. It is a worthwhile cd",292
2,"If every child were given a copy of this in school, the world would be a much better place. This book is one of the greatest comedic and science fiction works of all time.",171
2,Well this one is great! The key feature is that the plastic is soft and doesn't insist on curling where you don't want it. I have too many cables running all over already and don't need ones that won't stay where I want them.,225
2,Easy read. Less than an hour.One of the greatest books on personal accountability I've ever read. I have made it required reading for the staff and lay leadership at my church. And also for my teenage children!Recommend for anyone who wants to be the person who stands out postively within organizations where layoffs are on the horizon.,337
2,dropped my 2 headed work light off the deck...its 27 feet to the ground and both heads stayed working...no kidding tough bulbs....shipping was quick too...,155
2,"I bought this game when searching for Baldur's Gate 2 to tide me over, but it turned out to be much more than that. This is by far the best game I have ever played or seen. The story is immersive and interesting and the landscaping is extraordinary! It literaly creates a world for you to explore and discover.One cool feature is how you can actually tell exactly what weapon you're using when it is equiped. That made it really neat. The weapon designs are so awsome too!This is the best game I have ever played and I highly recommend it!",539
2,"This is a fabulous score, filled with beautiful passages. It contains what is arguably the best cue from film of all time - 'Stealing the Enterprise', a grand heroic segement that will make your heart swell with emotion. The other great passage is 'Bird of Prey Decloaks', an action cue not completley devoid of feeling. -1 star (should be two) for the puzzling addition of an 80's rock version of the theme and the omision of the escape from Genesis. It'll do though.",468
2,"I was looking for a piece of furniture to go in my home office. My computer desk is black so I went with this piece. It looks great! I put some clear plastic storage bins in the cubbies with decorative paper inside them to store my paper and other office supplies. On top are my printer and scanner. It was very easy to put together and everything is solid and heavy. I think it's an MDF type of wood, very easy to clean.",421
2,"This story is just so much more gripping than the majority of other stories of our time. It developd characters and explains them at a natural pace and lets you get familiar with them by putting them through many tests that also help the characters learn about themselves. The storyline is deep and it just grabs you and is exteremely well done. But, you'd think that a story as old as this one would be a difficult one to read and yet it is written so well that anyone can understand it, and the descriptions are just amazing as well. A great story to read.",558
2,"Although this book isn't as comprehensive as others in the songwriting department, it presents information in a very concise and interesting format. It also has a comprehensive section (half the book) on the BUSINESS. It's a quick, easy read and definitely worth the price. But if you want to get serious about songwriting, you'll also need a book with more theory such as WRITING MUSIC FOR HIT SONGS.",401
2,"Just the Lady of Shalot song is well worth the price of the cd, great cd.",73
2,They came very quickly and Were packaged very well. I love them. They matched the other Dublin Crystal I have. Very Nice. I do recomend them.Ken Gore,149
2,This is the second one of these I purchased. Nothing wrong with the first one. Just needed 2 of them. They bothwork great.,122
2,This movie was my favorite growing up. It's become a classic in my family as my daughter enjoys watching it as a young adult.,125
2,"I too have used a version of this product since I was 16 years old in the 80's, and I too have had people thinking that I am 10-15 years younger than my actual age. I attribute it partially to genes as well, but I often tell people that I've used Oil of Olay since I was 16! I've always loved this product - not greasy or oily, SPF 15, lightweight, great scent. For the price and quality, this one can't be beat!",412
2,"I bought one for a friend for Christmas and after that I am about to buy 3 more, including me. It fits tight but it is perfect. No problem.",139
2,"I managed to catch this on Turner Movies one night and loved it. The interplay between Ted Healy & the Stooges is good. The storyline is at times, very weak. But it shows the building of the Stooges. Least we not forget that there were FOUR Stooges in this film! Fred Sanborn was the ""silent"" Stooge and at times I wanted him to do more than whisper and wiggle his eyebrows.Do I recommend the film? YES for any Stooge fan! IT IS A MUST!Now MGM, get off yer cans and release ""Meet The Baron""!",491
2,"A long wait for a new release from Michael but this is sheer brilliance and has an air of magnatism to it. Senistively sung with a very meaningful interpretation. This is something very different for him but works extremely well. The tracks are well chosen, mixed and arranged. Excellent for relaxation after a long stressful day at work.",338
2,"Oh, MUCH better than the first! Very entertaining, and oh does she have a way with words. For instance, ""...the skyline begin to illuminate, yellow flames that gradually connected into pictures through the dusk, outlining buildings and steeples and streets, the indigo emptiness of parks checkerboarding the glow..."" and ""Firelight licked up his stockings in whispers and crackles and threw hot gold off the silver buckles of his shoes.""Oh me oh my, I can't wait for the next. Only 4 stars cause the very last page was a bit corny love talk. :)",544
2,"have to say this is the only sports bra that keeps my watermelons up. It does more than its job. I love this bra a lot, it sits my breast ups and hold them in place.",165
2,"Nice cleaning cloth, could be a little larger. It works well for smaller hands. Good product for the money. We use it at least three times daily.",145
2,"I bought these for my toddler daughter after trying several pairs of flipflops with the strap on the back. These are the easiest to keep on and for her to walk in. Also, the thong strap stays in the right place between her toes instead of slipping around between the other toes! They are really cute and very sturdy.",316
2,"In times of crisis, effective leaders understand the urgent need for honesty and candor, for the kind of truth telling that allows for healthy, creative responses....It is one of the graces of crises that truth telling unfetters the imagination and offers hope and direction...In the present church crisis, Paul Dinter emerges as a significant truth teller...Dinter has succeeded in writing a brave memoir and a penetrating critique of the current structures of the institutional church.",487
2,"I bought this camera ... 6 months later, I'm STILL trying to figure out all of the special effects! Great video and sound quality. Only drawback: little or no digital stabilizer on the zoom. Buy a tripod for tight zoom shots.",225
2,"An interesting novel with a plot placed in exciting countries. Characters have the intensity of latin people. This novel got the second place in ""Premio Planeta 1998"" (a famous Spanish award) but a lot of readers opine that it is much better than the winner.",258
2,Saw this in the theater first. This is a must own movie. You can watch it over and over and learn things from it. Also entertaining.,132
2,"This is a great book! It has a great hero, who thinks circles around his enemys: Bellarion is the brilliant boy raised in a monastary, who is always the chivalrous gentlemen, protects ladies and always does what is right. The whole book keeps you guessing at the plot, and is very well written. I have read several other books by this other and so far this is my favorite. It is my present favorite book right now, up there with ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Freckles"". This is not a quick read;it is a story you will want to savor. I highly recommend this book!",564
2,"My dog gets a little bored with this but I put peanut butter in it and freeze overnight and its a good treat. Plus, he is a heavy chewer and has not destroyed it yet.",166
2,"OK, to get the real deal package-wise I think you have to seek out the Japanese digipack with the pop-up of the band in the middle. But if you aren't into childrens-art-book styling like me, and just want the music, get this in any form. ""This Was"", their first effort, broke us into what they were all about, so then we were really ready for this when it came out. The bonus tracks fit fine thematically and don't mess up what was a nice cohesive LP in the first place. Never have been able to get ""Fat Man"" out of my head, maybe because it hits close to home.",561
2,"Another installment from our delightfull Mr McCauley. Unfortunately, I found that this addition to McCauley's works was not as magical. Somehow he only just fell short of another bestseller. However, if you have read his other books you must read this! If not go out and read some! McCauley has managed to see deeper into our lives than ever before! McCauley has a knack of capturing what we feel and think day in and day out. I'm just waiting for everyone to pick up on his genius! Am I the only one who can see a set of modern day classics?",542
2,"This mini SD card works well for me and I sure heartily recommend it since it's quite inexpensive, but works perfectly. Great bargain!",134
2,"Who is that coming online and hating on Olivia? Game is that you out there posting these things? Everyone knows how much Game likes to diss people, but in real life he's a little punk. Game is just a wanna be gangsta and a wanna be basketball player who got kicked out of college for being a dumba**. Game is the biggest wanna-be since Ja. And all of these little Game fans and WhackWall fans are just a bunch of losers who think they're cool just because they go against the majority opinion. Game's next album is going to flop, period.",537
2,"I really like the flavor of this, but does anyone know if this truly is not safe in pregnancy or just a disclaimer they have to put?",132
2,Switch does a great job in turning tree lights on and off at a touch of a finger. The little Christmas Tree metal piece you touch looks just like an ornament and connecting wire blends in with the tree. Saved me crawling on the floor to plug in or unplug the tree.,264
2,Loved the show! Highly underrated! LIstening to the CD brought it all back to me! The music is terrific even if you haven't seen the show.,138
2,I bought this book along with the progressive guitar method book 1 about four years ago and this is without a doubt the best beginner songbook out there.The book is all in melody notes and chords.The notes are large so there is no problem reading and deciphering them.It contains about fifty or so pages.If you start learning the guitar and need a complimentary songbook this is the one to get.I highly recommend it.,416
2,This was a great book. It keeps you guessing and on your toes not knowing what reacher will do next. This is a great book to turn into a movie.,143
2,Has good memory storage. bought it 4 my mom n she still hasn't filled it up yet. she loves her music and pics.,110
2,"I found the author's writing to be clear and concise, easy to understand, no legalese. The author's subtle humor and well-researched documentation of both little-known and well-known sports facts, legal manipulations involved, and legal precedents make this compilation of legal cases such an easy, pleasurable read that even those who thought they knew all there was to know in the sports world will be amazed, surprised, and enlightened. A great book for anyone who loves sports trivia. Knowledge of law not a prerequisite. Think Christmas gift!",547
2,"This book was probably R.L. Stine's best book (at least his best Goosebumps book). What I liked most, though, was the plot. Stine really hit it home with the creepy plot, which mostly is why this book is so good. It isn't really scary, but it really opens up your imagination.",276
2,"A nice, hefty feel, a big blade - quality USA craftmanship - and beautiful materials. I love it so much, I immediately bought more. This is truly an heirloom item. You won't be disappointed!!!",192
2,"This is a CD I never get tired of listening to. Every song on here is good and some of them are truly fantastic. My favorites are I Keep Forgettin, That's Why, and I Can Let Go Now (which should have been a really big hit song.)If you're new to the music of Michael McDonald because of his recent Motown albums, then you should do yourself a favor and pick this one up, too.",374
2,"Come on, how can you resist Bob ""Cat"" Goldthwait and the voice of John Candy as a talking horse in the same movie? This is one of the unsung heros of the slapstick 80's heyday. It takes me back to memories of Police Academy and Porky's. But somehow it's even better. And Virginia Madson? Don't even get me started!",314
2,I like to collect Mustang memorabilia. I have a relatively new mustang but also have a 69 Mark I that I take out on special occasions. My girlfriend bought me this chair and I was really excited to add it to my collection. I was doubly happy to see over time that it is made pretty well and seems like it will hold up over time.,328
2,"As much as I would like to I am dubious about buying this item as it was not due until the end of 07.As the price tag of $145.00, I would hate to wind up with an inferior set for that cost. Can anyone assure me that it is the OFFICIAL release, arriving early. Whenever it does, Hallelujah!!!",291
2,"This book covers all the quantitative topics around the loss distribution approach for OR. It follows an actuarial-driven approach to explain the models for frequency, severity and aggregation of loss distribution, and the relative statistical estimating and testing. But do not look for OR management topics in this book: it give its best in the actuarial measurement of operational risk.",389
2,My Grandmother gave this cookbook as a gift to my Mother and I. My Mother lost hers and can't live without it. I purchased it from Amazon to replace her lost copy. So many good recipes. Many have become staples at family get togethers and for holidays. This is my favorite cookbook.,282
2,"This was my first Virginia Kantra book & I loved it! This book had two great lead characters, a good storyline & some humor. I really enjoyed Lexie & Jack. I look forward to Ms. Kantra's next book!",197
2,"This is the 11th in a series of videos called ""I Love Toy Trains"" and I think it is the best yet! Jeff, who has been around since the first video has grown with each one and does a great job of being the M.C. He does magic tricks, talks about the Maui Ocean Center and shows a great deal of knowledge about the toy trains featured in the video. There are still the jokes and a puppet for extra entertainment, even flying saucers and aliens are included in the fun! Great addition to the I Love Toy Train series.",511
2,bought this as a gift for my partner for Christmas. I was in New York when it arrived and he opened it and is wild about it. Perfect for our applications,153
2,"While perhaps not for the absolute beginner, this yoga sequence is definitely an excellent way to get a solid upper body and back workout in a short space of time.",163
2,"This product does cut down on gas and bloating. I take it before meals and it does wonders. Be sure to drink it with cold (not hot or warm) water to wash it down. If you don't, you may experience some peppermint reflux. I like this formulation better than the one she had used many years ago. The product performs like it says it does. I recommend it highly.",358
2,It works exactly as it's supposed to. I've had no issues with this handle cover at all. Way too easy. And it works with my other brands of cast iron as well.,157
2,"Truly enjoyed this book. Fun read, stimulating as well as informative. Highly recommend for all believers as well as non believers alike.",137
2,My 10yr old daughter is in love with this book and is constantly asking me to buy her another book! Which says a lot for a story!,129
2,This game is classic mario style but with all of his cool new moves and some new power ups like the Giant mushroom. Game play is fun and easy for kids (platformer). Colors are vibrant and shading is flawless. Also features vs. mode and mini games that are especially fun to play with the stylus. My son and I really liked this one. To bad he lost it just one month later. Downside to such small cartridges.,406
2,I found this book to be informative and thought stimulating. Spong tells it like it is and is not afraid to present new ideas. Recommend for everyone.,150
2,We really appreciate having this monitor. It is worth the money. The sensor works really well and having two monitors makes it easy for both of us to listen in. The sensor immediately picks up when our daughter is out of her crib so remember to turn it off first or the alert will sound! It definitely helps us to sleep especially with SIDS and all of the other cautions.,371
2,"This was purchased to go on a fire department brush truck to replace several other, often cheaper, winches that had been broken, including a Ramsay. After two years, this winch has been used and abused and has came through with flying colors, never failing to pull out whatever was stuck.Don't fall for cheaper products. Invest in a good winch and never have to worry...",370
2,"These jeans offers great style and fit. The fabric is a nice modern blue wash. The cut is loose fit as advertised.However, I had to work harder than I wanted to in order to convince my husband to wear them. The button didn't fit through the hole until I used scissors to widen the hole. Also, the zipper was stuck and REALLY hard to move until I took a Dove bar to it.After all the effort, I think they are going to be really nice for him to wear, now, though.",460
2,"I'll Put this in one word ""AWESOME"" these guys are great i first heard about them from a friend and they sounded good so i downloaded the song ""The Greastest Fall(Of All Time)"" and i liked it so i then downloaded the whole EP West Is For Wishing(i think thats what it's called) and thought it rocked so waited til' their CD Stories and Alibis came out and then bought it and the CD was just as good as the EP so i say congrats to this band with their CD and i hope they gain alot of fans and come out with many more CD's in the future",534
2,"I very rarely need to change belts with this. It's as though the belts last forever when you unclog them with it. I compare using this to using a pencil eraser, except that the surface is moving and the eraser is not. Buy this. You won't regret it. Why waste money on new belts?",278
2,"Ok so by now we all know that i'm the QUEENS biggest fan. Her music speaks to me in ways it can't possibly speak to anyone else. This is one of Mary's best cds. She delivers such a great and powerful performance on the entire album. If you are a true Mary ""The Queen"" J. Blige you will lovethis album.If you are new to the Quees you will become insitantly a MJB Fanatic!",370
2,"The best record yet by the Dublin brothers. Everything from Talk Talk, David Sylvian, The Blue Nile and Crowded House influences make this a record that will be a calssic ""must have"" in 20 years. Talent will out, and they certainly have it in spades.",250
2,Check Six! made me laugh and cry and kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. It also gave me a better understanding of how an aircraft carrier works and how the different personnel work together to accomplish the mission. There was plenty of high powered flying and shipboard intrigue.,310
2,"Janis is one of the very best, if not the best singer songwriters. These recordings represent some of the best vocals and songwriting of those times. She's full of emotion and beauty. You must buy this!",202
2,I really enjoy Gabriel Iglesias. I like the tapes of him alone. There is no comparisions to others. Looking for more tapes of him.,130
2,Bought this to replace a failed Sony Front Speaker for a TV room entertainment system. The sound coming from this little workhorse is a thing of beauty. Picks up dialogue perfectly and at the right volume. Would buy again.,222
2,Very good book for building Mopars famous 727 for street or strip use. Covers rebuilding for street/towing to performance enhancements tips. Good book for all builders and hobbyist.,181
2,"I'm also 33 years old but my parents actually had the LP of this great album. (What's a CD?) However it's been collecting dust for 25 years since it's too worn out to listen to. Plus, where is that darned old record player anyway! After recently acquiring this LP on CD, trust me, you'll be glad to hear this fine ""tribute to the best"" in true 21st century hi-fi sound (CD quality). Oh yeah, the songs are all good to, but I've loved this album since the '70s. Ahh Haa.",469
2,"The CDN TM8 timer comes with nice features that are not included in others intended for the same purpose. Maybe the best is that if you are using it to count down, when it reaches ZERO, it starts counting up, letting you know how long it has been since the count ended. The negative side is that the beeper is not as loud as was the Sunbeam digital timers I had a number of years ago. So would I buy more. I don't know. I love the clock, less the beeper.",454
2,"The book is alive with Dickensonian intensity and detail, and expands onto new turf Wolfe's mean spirited but comic vision of a materialistic America. But it is flawed in plot, structure and the development of characters as they respond to the events (such as they are) in the book. I spent most of the book entertained by Wolfe's powers of observation, but waiting with growing impatience for something significant to happen. When events reached their climax, I was disappointed.",480
2,"Massie narrates a complex history simply, directly and fairly. One is surprised by the intensity of the human drama of the last of the Romanovs and the people of Russia. Its relevance is particularly poignant today as Massie presents both a portrait of a society in transformation and of human interaction in crisis. The book approaches you as history and leaves you drained emotionally, quite an accomplishment and a delightful one at that.PH",443

2,"This is a very energizing and harmonizing work out that helps to cleans and center. The whole workout is well structured with relaxation and short meditation sessions, which was perfect for centering. I did this work out on the weekend after a very tiring week. The results were amazing. I felt like I had a very refreshing holiday in just 60 min.",347

2,"Amazon:Your presentation of the offered product was succinct, to the point and informative. I am more than pleased with the visual product. All the dvd's were without blemish, the color definition excelent; but the packaging of the dvd's was problematic. The individual dvd containers seperated from the six-disc cover, thus making insertion into the cover jacket difficult.Ask me about Nikita, the 3rd season. That review will be more crictical.",446
2,"I have had it for a month and use it daily as an alarm clock and occasionally for a nap timer. Keeps perfect time as far as I can tell. Things I wish it had: 1. Graduated alarm volume...start off low, then grow louder if not snoozed or shut off. 2. Larger/smoother alarm turn off switch. 3. No beep sound when you hit the snooze button to see what time it is at night. 4. Ability to operate snooze button when unit is closed.",425
2,i bought these recently and was a little skeptical due to the low price but i was pleasantlysurprised. The noise reduction is awesome ! As for audio quality they sound terrible with thenoise reduction off but 100% better with it on. They still sound a little muddy to me lackingin the mids and highs compared to Bose but for less than one third the price I can live with it.For the money I would buy them anytime !,414
2,"This album has some very creative beats which wake up your mind. The other albums offered here (ragga jungle anthems 1 and 2) are excellent as well, but Toasted has some extra flavor and innovation. Ragga Jungle Anthems 1 and 2 are good if you like to hear junglist versions of dancehall hits. Toasted is the choice if you want a pure high-grade jungle experience. Also, the album is packaged nicely.",400
2,"The blurb really says it the best...""There are more than 6,000 Chinese medicinals described in the Chinese medical literature, but only 260 of these are typically used in day to day practice.

2,If you like the sound of Africa then you will like this. Great harmony and rhythm. Easy listening. Great buy.,109
2,Love this film! Carell is great as the villain you love to hate and the minions are hilarious. The kids are adorable but I'm scared how the sequel will do. Here's hoping they have as great of a story as they did in this first one!,230
2,"This documentary combines a fine objective balance between the realistic frustrations in political diplomacy and the optimistic humanism of a caring peacemaker. Very inspiring, it gives a closer look at the personal dimension in trying to resolve global conflicts.",264
2,"It's an interesting example of how far you can take a system, it's a well-done RPG on its own merits, and having played it now I can say it's easy to run. I enjoyed it and recommend it.",185

2,"I expected studying for my first mcse exam to be tough, but it wasn't. I had several friends recommend this book, so I picked it up. I was concerned about some of the topics that may have been out of my reach, but following the exercises in the book made it perfectly clear. Thanks for helping me pass the exam.",311
2,This is a relaxing CD that i enjoy listening to when i get home from work or have had a stressing day in general. Well worth listening to,137
2,"Pros: everythingCons: NothingComments: I don't see what these random 4 stars are talking about, i.e. bad indoor pics and slow charging. This camera is great, small, fast, high quality, and easy to use. I bought mine for 150$ and it even came with a partially charged li-ion battery. It's nice not having to take the batteries out all the time also, just plug the AC adapter in it and let it sit for a while. I'm VERY glad I got this camera.",440

2,CHER - LIVING PROOF is really GREAT!All tracks are cool. Thanks CHER. You're the BEST!!,87
2,"Definitely a page-turner, a captivating love story. The author guides you through the intensely interesting history of the Mughal empire and leaves you wanting to know more. Unfortunately, she leaves you hanging, just as newly-titled Nur Jehan comes to throne. I would have liked to know more about her life as Empress, and how she carried out her duties. I also recommend reading a little about the Mughal Empire itself to give some perspective (that is if you are interested in teh actual history of it all). I'll definitely check out her sequel.",548
2,"These are really nice, but I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because they aren't perfect for the price/quality. Nice size, but the proportions are a little off. We have tons of Marquis by Waterford and LOVE all the stemware. These are nice because they go with the set. I highly recommend them for water and have heard the actual water glasses break very easily.",355

2,"i love this cat box! it keeps everything covered and smelling fresh with the charcoal filter. however, my only problem with this is that the liner keeps coming out of the one clasp after my cat uses it so i have to continue to adjust it every now and again. overall though, i am highly satisfied with my purchase!",313
2,"I really like using this, it's easy, painless and by far one that requires the least effort =) Wish the replacement pads come in bigger pack.",141

2,"Murphy has done a better than average job of pulling together the technical considerations of loudspeaker design. He focuses on closed and vented designs sufficient to allow the first timer a fighting chance at successfully designing and building a speaker. The use of symbols is less than admirable, frequently mixing lower case and upper case symbols (see ""F(sc)"" on pp 48 v. ""f(sc)"" on pp 26). Proofreading would have made the book more enjoyable (""sign wave,"" pp 47). Editorial comments aside, if you want a relevant and timely book for the beginner this is it.",565
2,"I really like this workbook. It has reviews of many skills and facts in a short time, a quick lesson, and then practice of the lesson learned. It ends with one word problem.",173
2,The character in the movie wasn't quite as scary to me as in the book. Also the writer character in the movie wasn't as compelling as the book but over all the story is good and there is always a new twist just when you think you have it figured out.,250
2,"GOOD FOR THE PRICE.IT IS NICE AND USEFUL ESPECIALLY THE BIG BOWL.THE SMALLER ONES ARE O.K ,IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BIGGER.",123
2,I was thrilled to receive the knife the day before Christmas Eve so I could give it to my Dad in time. It was a terrific buy and he loved it. Thanks!,149
2,"A very quick read, probably because it was intended for the young adult reader. That being said, this is a good book for said audience, with just the right amount of all the elements that make up a mystery novel, while letting more of the important values stand out - family, friendship, forgiveness, letting go and moving forward.",331
2,"My one year old will play with this for hours. I think the recommended age should be a bit higher than six months though--she had no interest in it until she was older. Once my daughter could pick up the balls and put them in the holes, it became fun for her.",259
2,As far as I know the person who wanted the lamps are happy. I don't know any more. they haven't complained.,107

2,"We ordered two of these airbeds. I gave it four stars because the second one had a leak, which we didn't discover until my daughter slept directly on the floor! I returned it (very easy process) and received a replacement very quickly (no leaks!). Easy to inflate and deflate, I think this product is well worth the money!",322
2,"I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. This set is exactly what I expected. The quality of the wood is good and actually better quality than I woud have thought for the price. My husband had it put together in less than 1/2 hour. The first day she had it, she spent the entire day playing dress up and make up. Her dad said he had to pry her away from it to get her to eat lunch. I am very pleased with it and would recommend this product to anyone.",474

2,"The title is a bit too vague-- this book is specifically on *Japanese* methods of minimizing clutter, which may or may not be useful to westerners. But what a fascinating topic it is. Only the Japanese could have thought of storing things below the floor, futons that can be rolled up and put away when they aren't in use, ""borrowing the view"" of your neighbour's garden, and so on. The photography isn't dazzling, and many of the homes aren't very stylish, but it's worth reading just to appreciate the ingenious ideas the Japanese have.",538
2,I liked Tuck Everlasting but it wasn't my favorite. I liked the idea of living forever. I would want to do this if my friends decided to live as long as I did. I was puzzled by one thing. I just don't get why Winnie didn't go with the Tucks.She had a chance to live forever but she didnt take it. Her only friends were the Tucks. I won't ever understand that. Other than that the book was really good.,401

2,"I just bought this book and it was so interesting I read it all in one day, excelent grafics, everything was easy to understand and laid out just right so anyone could understand it. The only problem I found was that it didn't go as deep as I wanted to but still deep enough to keep you busy for a few months putting into practice what you learn in the book.",358
2,"Classic - if you haven't seen this movie, you need to drive to the video store tonight and rent it. Absolutely wonderful acting, great storyline, fantastic plot. Dustin Hoffman at his best. Tom Cruise is only mildly annoying as well. Great flick!!",247
2,The book was fun and exciting. It was very unique and kept you wanting to read page after page. we did not want to put the book down. We believe this book would be great for any child to read.,192
2,Loved it. You won't be disappointed in any of it. I love displaying the Ten Commandments on my table. Really looks cool ;o),123
2,"Mr. Christensen's techniques are realistic and straight-forward, while still very challenging. He discusses everything about training on your own (supplementary to dojo training, not in place of it), including sections such as how to keep motivated and training outdoors. His instructions/teachings are clear and concise. I strongly recommend this book, and all others by Mr. Christensen, for that matter.",405
2,This case fits the Nuvi 660 very snugly. It serves its purpose well in that it helps to protect the screen when the unit is not in use. One potential problem is that some screen protectors will come off when putting the GPS in the case because the fit is so snug.,263
2,"First of all, if you read my other review on this CD,I said it was his worst album,but I changed my mind,I listened to it all the way through and actually found it more enjoyable than his previous albums. If you were lucky like me, You might have got a copy with a bonus DVD. The best songs are Superman,cleaning out my closet,Till I collapse,when the music stops,soldier,and Buisness. If you are an Eminem fan,or a rap fan,you probably will like this album.",458
2,"This is the 4th pair of Rainbow sandals I have purchased for my college age children...and this one a replacement for some ""well worn"" ones! They are a great product and worth the money, yes a bit much for ""flip flops"" but these are not ""flip flops"" and are well worth the money!",279
2,"When I first heard of this book, I had to get it... I mean Richard Hell! I love him!From the second I opened this book I couldn't put it down. Not to say it was fantastic, but it was so real. It felt like walking into someone's brain (primal/animalistic urges). Fascinating.Through every chapter you got to know the inner workings of this addict, what moved them and destroyed them. In short, how fragile life is, and how misdirected we can be by our intuition under the influence of anything and everything. Air included. Buy this. Read it. Be disturbed.",555
2,Came quickly and before ChristmasFree shipping made it economicalJust what we wanted to purchase,96
2,Very happy with the product and it was exactly what I was looking for. Also it came at a great price.,101

2,"It had a great moral that anyone could do anything he inspired to, but it took lots of practice and hard work to go to great heights.Jonathan was an inspiration to some of the younger gulls, but others sat on the shore doing nothing. This is a good example of the real world",274

2,"The software that comes with this mouse is great, especially since it allows you to assign different uses for the buttons for each program you use. This greatly increases the functionality of this mouse and eases the burden on my wrists. The only drawback is that the size is too large for small hands like mine. So perhaps it will force me to purchase another one to prevent my carpel tunnel from getting worse instead of helping. I'm waiting to see.",451
2,"Good MorningI am a crossword fanatic. I have used this dictionary for a few years now, and finally it started falling to pieces. It got to the stage I just couldn't repair it any more.

2,"This is listed as only subtitles but Sentai always dubs anything that is a Bluray release, and has been confirmed by them.As far as this series is concerned it is a must see. It has a fairly unique storyline or unique elements and the characters are hard not to love.",267
2,"I liked this book a lot until the end, which I didn't like so much. The mystery and suspicion surrounding the main character was well-done.",139
2,"This is another book that I frequently recommend to people who come in our shop. It combines scientific information and metaphysical information, is easy to understand and has great photos.

2,"So well done! This is such a well-written and wonderfully performed story of an aristocratic, early 1900's, British family and the staff ""downstairs"" who serve them, and bring with them their own personal stories that add intrigue and authenticity. This series has such great characters in an amazing setting and with the most beautiful costumes. How could anyone, young or old, not love it?",391
2,"I purchase the Teen Trends outfits for my Mini Super Dollfie (Luts Delf Kid), and they fit great, minus the shoes. The boots, if you slit the back the rest of the way down, fit my girl for photographing purposes, but the backs of her feet don't fit completely. I love the fact that the boots have hidden velcro on the back to keep them from opening or falling off...really great quality! The skirt is a bit too poufy, but easily flattened. Great little leggings, adorable skirt, and beautiful corset style top in black velvet! Really sweet, and looks great on MSDs!",565
2,Makes a very good edge in very little time with little skill. Not for Japanese knives!,86
2,"Excellent book recommended by my professor @ school.Covers just about everything structural!Exlent details , will be a reference for me forever.",144
2,"This movie is pretty amusing when you want something light to watch. Coming from a Minnesotan, I thought all of their accents were really forced but, hey, they tried. Anyway, its good fun but not to be taken seriously. We're not really trailer trash here. Lona Williams is from my town (rosemount) so it was fun to see familiar scenery in this movie.",350

2,"I've been using a hand sharpener from the local grocery store for a while. This beats it hands down.I just finished sharpening a paring knife with nicks in the blade. I was able to grind down the nicks and leave the blade looking and working like brand new. I was even able to shave a bit of my forearm with the paring knife when I was done!4 Stars instead of 5, because it has to surprise me to get 5. I expected high quality from this and that was easily met!",461
2,"This router is well suited for the small job or occasional encounter with a heavier workload. The case although stylish, next to the other tools in the truck, lacks for good storage space and often allows your bits to bounce around inside. I have had troubles with the fine tune control knob. It does not stay put and allows the plate to drift when making frequent material changes. Still, I'm very happy with it, it has made me money and the work has turned out great.",469
2,"I have had no problems with this knife. The price is good, blade is sharp, and the safety works great. The pocket clip does seem to be getting a little loose after a few months, but so far it has not broke. The spring assist makes it easy to manipulate with one hand. Overall it is a nice little tool to have on you in case of an emergency.",340
2,"Dr. Dennett puts some interesting twists on evolutionary theory. This text is accessible to people without much science background, and yet thought-provoking enough for the professional scientist.",196
2,"My daughter and I had read the book and wanted to see how the movie compared. The book is better (as are most books) but as far as kids movies go, this one's a winner. The kids are cute and not sassy, like on many sitcoms. The adults are more than 1-dimensional. The relationships between the characters are nuanced, but not too complex for an 8 year old girl to understand. Really great family movie.",401
2,"I read many 87th Precinct books early in my life.The main characters are still in place with a few new names.The descriptive style McBain applied always cleared one's visionof the people, places, seasons of the year.An excellent series with guaranteed plot twists and always one, or more,detectives in a jam.",308
2,"After seeing the movie ""Four Christmases"" this year (starring Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn), my son (13 years old) thought Taboo looked like a fun game.

2,"I listened to this book on tape. The reader did an adequate job of presenting the story.The basic plot and twists are interesting. However, anyone with any knowledge of how the legal system works would not buy into this storyline. This trial would become a mistrial many times over. Fortunately our legal system is better than Grisham portrays it to be.I did not feel this book was as compelling as many of Grisham's other novels. However, the ending of this book was much more satisfactory than most of his other stories.",522
2,Ok so this was a good book it downloaded quickly and smoothly. I had no problems reading this on my fire. I would recommend this book to anyone young or old,156

2,"coolest strap system I've seen. fits easily in your pocket.at first I didn't think the angle was adjustable - but you effectively can by moving it up and down on your forehead.also - it can sit flat on the floor / ground with the light at a 45 degree angle. useful for a small area light.the light is bright and highly defused. favors lighting up a large area close to you as opposed to spotting at a distance.previously owned a princeton aurora - which was good, but I like this one a lot better.",497
2,"These candies are delicious. The shipment arrived within 2 days of the order date (thanks to prime) and were extremely fresh! They did not have the consistency I was expecting, but they're great nonetheless. I guess I was expecting them to be a little more ""tough"", but that can be easily achieved after opening the bag and letting them.. stale up a bit.. But either way I was very impressed with the freshness and taste of these gummi candies as well as the prompt delivery.",475
2,"This is a Koontz novel that has monsters, but they are not genetically engineered or have crashed landed on earth from outer space. The scary monsters in this book are all human, and sick as any of the other evil stuff Koontz has wrote about. More of a suspense tale, it has some nail-biting chase sequences and some horror-type serial killer stuff going on in it. Koontz here is making a statement about big government in this book, and what Big Brother may do if you know too much. Great Read.",495
2,"A UV filter is simply a must have. I bought 2, one for each lens when I purchased the camera. Whether or not it actually affects UV rays is secondary to its real function - to protect the lens and keep it dust free and possibly fingerprint and rain drop free. A very small investment, any photographer should make immediately.",326
2,"I love anime and a friend told me about trigun, a this is a series worth your time and money. There's action, comedy, drama, and of course LOVE AND PEACE!!!! For 26 episodes the series of trigun is a classic, and should be picked up by any person who is a anime fanatic, and since the dvd set has all 26 episodes, it saves alot of time and effort when u can just watch them that way instead of looking for every dvd to the series.",430
2,I enjoyed this story and really liked the characters. It was an exciting adventure even though it's not one I'd ever want to go on myself. :-) I thought it was well written and the conversations flowed nicely and were believable.,229
2,"Havent tested it too much, but it seems to last just as long as the nikon battery. For the price you definitely can't beat this as your spare/backup battery to use in a pinch.",175
2,"You are in the market for something truly original, and you are willing to play it twice before listening, and you love great vocals, fabulous melodies and a hint of Hendrix. Give this a try.I have had this CD in my car for a month, running. I have not had a cd capture my imagination like this for years!Warning. If you only like stuff that sounds like everything else you've heard, don't bother.",397
2,"I really like the current method of walking through each topic, with a ""you have completed 7 of 20 steps"" dialogue. I also like the table of topics, with a notation of whether you've covered it or not, and with a click you can return directly to the topic once you've collected more data.",288
2,Good plot & first rate performance from Madonna & Willem Dafoe. Madonna is so sexy in this film.,96
2,"Hibbard unfolds Caravaggio's life, style and works with a firm grip , avoiding what normally bores the uninitiated but retaining an interesting approach for those who are well versed in the works of this 16th century genius. He avoids a biased approach which very often taints the ever increasing number of Caravaggio critics. Though new material has since been published, this book still retains the requisites of a must -to -read",431
2,Super happy with this product. Paper is perfect for folding and the variety of colors is perfect for anything you might be looking for!,135
2,Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. d,98
2,"Rodney says if you put this and Jewel of the South together, you have three quarters of a good album. But this is one of my favorites. The back stories on some of the songs make it special as well as the collaboration with Guy Clark and back up from artists Trisha Yearwood and Patty Loveless. If you are a fan it will not disappoint, if you are a music aficionado looking to track the artist's growth and change this a the best of the ""Sony Years"".",449
2,"I had the pleasure of studying in a yeshiva for many years, but I enjoy this anthology of the classical commentaries and the scholarly and accurate translation.",160
2,"This was the 1st Dean Koontz I've read, although recommendations for his books have been suggested. While some parts drag on forever (mostly the beginning) the book was pretty cool. The only really bad thing was that he was a baker and the descriptions always made me hungry! Other than that Koontz has made his way permanently to my bookshelves.",346
2,"It is a great product and lasted a long time. The only real problems i had were that the straps broke off in the wash, it was hard to get out the poo inside it, and the bedding stuck to it. Now, its no as bad as I'm making it sound. I will buy more when i get the chance. Its not one of those products you get and say ""I wasted my money on this garbage?"" its like a notebook: It works well then all of a sudden you run out of space or it rips. I would definitely recommend this product though.",493
2,It works well for me.I had many make up brushes and this is one of best brush that I own.I use it for blush /bronzer / highlighter.I look good :) Thank you!,156
2,"This game's top notch spot are MINI-GAMES! The Skating B-Ball game is quite cool! The Inner Tube races I like the most, it just seems sooooooo cool!",148
2,"Worked as promised, the slicon part of the handle got close to the cooking fire and it got kind of melted.",106
2,"3Canal has fulfilled the promise that was shown in Book of Blue in 1997. Musically, 3 Canal used live instrumentation to bring an edge and authenticity to the sound of the album, and took on the challenge of expressing the versatility of the rapso flow over a diverse range of rhythms from calypso and the pulsating jab jab rhythm to Latin, funk, groove, ambient, drum & bass and dance influences.And these guys can really SING!I particularly like ""Peace Chant"" and ""I Believe"".This cd is definitely worth buying. It's great driving & dancing music.",549
2,"We purchased several ride on and push trucks for our son this Christmas and this one was one of our least favorite. Putting it together was a breeze. But, we have found that we would have preferred a button to turn off the noise. It is also made for smaller children.",267
2,"This product was half of what most retail stores charge. It is padded on the inside to protect a scope. This is a great case for carrying to and from the range or for storing in a closet or under the bed. I dont know that I would want to throw it behind the seat of my truck and forget about it, but it is definetly a nice quality soft case for an excellent price. Fits an m-4 with a 3-9 x 40 scope nicley and the 5 outter magazine pockets are a nice feature.",459
2,"I really enjoyed this movie, mostly because the soundtrack is absolutly amazing. It's a cool little timeless story about young love in NY that has it's kwarky moments of intelligent humor. Definitly worth a watch and a buy.",223
2,"There are some CD's that you listen to once and know the lyrics by heart, and this is one of them. The first 4 songs are the best, but the whole album is worthwhile. My only complaint is a little diddy she says about ""Where'd you Throw the Ham"" or something like that, I wish I could just delete that from the CD. If you enjoy this, you will LOVE Patty Griffin ""Living with Ghosts"". Their voices are so similar it's eerie.",422
2,"This book is a quick read. I read it in a matter of a few hours. The main character, Jerry Brudos, is repulsive and disturbing. Ann Rule does a fantastic job of telling his sick and twisted story. There were times when I felt a queasiness in my stomach. If you easily have nightmares, read this during the daytime. A real spine tingler!",336
2,"Ok, so there will always be a new version in the works, ok. But face it, Microsoft does good. Every time they issue a new ""Windows"" it is a success and an improvement.More? Well, some have their doubt and problems here. Just be old-computer aware to support your desires (if you have problems). Meaning, there are going to be plenty of new things in every ""Windows"" release, but since '98 you can choose whether to use them or not. Go with what you know for awhile and transition (or not) -- like I did with the single-click.Good clicking to all and to all I'm out.",565
2,This is an awesome product helped organize my pantry works great and holds several different boxes makes my pantry look great.,126
2,"So this was my first fine watch purchase and Amazon made it nice and easy. I would suggest that you check out the watch in person and jewelry. You can't beat the price that Amazon will give you. What I like about this version of Aquaracer is the waffle face, the automatic movement and the band. The band has two tones of silver that works well with the black/grey face.I believe that this watch is appropriate in all settings. The dial is very bright at night, so no worries there. Great buy...even better price.",513
2,I would not recommend this for really young children because they will not understand the premise of the show but by about age 8 they would be able to understand what the young girl is learning and can understand what is happening in the movie.,244
2,"I liked this album a lot when i first heard it but it got a little bit old. The album starts off with a really bad intro(probably the worst intro i've ever heard) and then goes into Not give a f*** my favourite song. Call Me, Can't Let You Go and sickalicious are all mad songs. But songs like damn and my life with a really bad guest appearance of mary j blige are bad. I would rather go out and get a brilliant cd like lil kim",428
2,"I pinned this poster in my boys homework room along with the periodic tables and other ""must have"" science posters. Yes, I am a nerd.",133
2,"Since reading Gates of Fire I've been hooked on Pressfield's work, both fiction (Killing Rommel is another favorite) and non-fiction (EVERYONE should read The War of Art!). But not since i read Shogun more than 30 years ago has a book transported me through time and space the way Gates of Fire does. The setting is so real, the characters are so genuine, and the action is so believable that you can almost hear the din of battle and feel the fear and anguish of those on the killing lines of one of the most important battles in the history of the world.",556
2,What a picture!!!!!!!when you watch a dvd on this baby...you will be in heaven!! I will be getting hdtv thru directv soon..and after that I may never go to the movie theater again..it is that good! The only problem i have is the set is in my bedroom and when i have it on late at nite and the volume is low i can hear the fan...but don't let that stop you from buying this t.v.,377
2,I believe it took me all of 3 days to read this book simply because I couldn't put it down. I will be sending this to my best friend to read along with a fan that has our secret language on it. It was sad yet very complelling...,228
2,What an original voice in this beautiful tale of the trek west to Oregon. The author's insight into relationships caught me right away. But the beautiful descriptions of the land kept me going. It makes you consider the land and what it offered in a new way. I found the family relationships touching and the resolution between the character somehow felt right.,361
2,Overall I am happy with this purchase. I got this to put in a krafts room and it has been really useful so far. Would definitely buy again.,139
2,Its a very good player with an excellant ease of use. The sound clarity is very good and has a very user friendly interface. It definitely is a strong buy!!!,157
2,I've read all three of Milletts Sherlock in Minnesota and this one was my favourite so far. I enjoy the interface of the refined Victorian detective with the quarks and characters of Minnesota. His stories have become progressively more fun to read. I really enjoy the addition of Rafferty to our crime fighting team.,317
2,"For many years I had listened to my mother's album of this concerto by Zino Francescatti, but decided to upgrade to a CD. I was concerned that no other version could measure up, but Anne Sophie Mutter had a dazzling interpretation and the NY Philharmonic complemented her nicely.Simply exquisite - a joy to savor with a nice glass of wine after a rough day's work!",364
2,Sissy Spacek gives a great performance in this tale of a young girl who is severly taunted by her classmates. This movie is so thrilling Iv watched it 5 times already. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good thrilling and even revengful move like this one !,265
2,"I cannot believe that the reviews for this book are not amazing. This book winds together beautifully. It's great for teenagers, managing to be remarkably true to life, as as well as interesting and unique.I loved it.",217
2,"Very easy to wash. Not as thick as I thought they would be, but am still satisfied. Does not require a lot of cooking spray. Overall I enjoy this product.",154
2,Recently read it on a recommendation. Easy to picture the action in your head. Authors showed great choice of words and actions to get message across. Surprise Ending.,167
2,What a great buy! The extreme flexability and lightweight of this hose makes using any nailer much easier. When working on scaffolding you are never fighting the weight of the hose. I could not go without this hose!!,216
2,"Rique Pantoja is a master of keyboards and pianos, and Tommy Walker is a pretty good guitarist; they are accompanied by:- Justo Almario / Saxophone- John Ferraro / Drums- Guillermo Guzman / Bass- Bob Wilson / Programmingand many more. . .Very relaxing and refined.",264
2,Excellent gift. It is very useful. My dad love it and use it for every thing. It is a excellent tool,100
2,"I first heard about the donnas 3 years ago, on the radio, the local lounge, and thought hey were great!! You can also see girls in Drive Me Crazy and Jawbreakers, as themselves, It would so rock if they had played at my prom !! My favorite song other than ""Take it off"", is ""too bad about your girl"" !! Pick up the cd it rocks !!...",332
2,"I take salsa lessons, do a lot of workout videos and am in pretty good shape. While this video isn't much of a cardio or dance challenge for me, it is fun and a good way to break up the monotony of aerobic workouts. The instructor has great energy and the music is enjoyable. The steps were not hard to learn, but I can see what the other reviewers meant--that she is not good at cuing throughout the combinations, but you can still pick up the steps without too much trouble. Overall, I thought it was a fun way to spice up working out.",537
2,This mount was worth every penny. It does not move from where you put it while driving. No more ugly circle marks on windshield. If you are on the fence about making this purchase just do it. You wont regret it.,211
2,"The ferrero rocher chocolates were fresh and well protected in the plastic container. If you like hazelnuts, you will love this candy.",134
2,A very scary but entertaining book. Good read before bedtime. The religious aspect of the book very thought provoking as well.,126
2,"What idiot canceled this show and why wasn't another network smart enough to pick it up? If you like the seductive vampire thing, this show does it well.",153
2,"When I finished the book, I was glad I had read it. But it took a long time to read it as the first third seemed to just go on and on and on. The second third was o.k. reading. The last of the book was excellent and made it worth the time.It got mixed reviews from my friends....people seemed to either REALLY like it or really didn't....few inbetweens.",353
2,"Finally, a second album from a promising songsmith that isn't the pits! An actual improvement IMHO over her first. A bit more rocking as a whole, but finishes up with three pensive tunes.My personal favorites are ""Funnyman"" (a rocker) and ""Beauty of Uncertainty"" (slow Western feel).",283
2,"I received this album when I was 10 years old, and knew all the lyrics...15 years later, I still do! This album contains some of Goldman's best songs: ""Puisque tu pars"", ""Il y a"", ""Il changeait la vie""...they are all so beautiful.",230
2,"A GREAT ALBUM FROM ONE OF THE BEST. THE FRENCH ALBUM IS CELINE AT HER BEST (AS ALWAYS). MY FAVORITE SONGS:POUR QUE TU M'AIMES ENCORE, REGARDE-MOI, & JE SAIS PAS.CELINE CAN DO NO WRONG, BLESS HER HEART!",201

2,"I have a Black and Desk 14.4 drill, and this charger does work with the ps140 batteries. One of my dead batteries actually charged in less than an hour. Great charger for the price.",181
2,"In my opinon this CD only comes second to Bone Thugs E. 1999 Eternal. And the reason I say that is beacause there are a couple of weak tracks, but hey this is 2 CD'S here you cant expect it to be perfect, but its is pretty close.",229
2,"I was quite pleased with the Equus 3721. I especially like the that it displays to hundredths, and the swiveling display makes it much easier to read in my cockpit. The value (price vs. performance) is astounding!I would like to have a similar product that displays to hundredths of a volt using LED instead of LCD. I would pay two or three times the price for that.",366
2,I have been looking into e-books for some time... I decided to get a Kindle and I have been so happy with it. The Internet connection feature is amazing! It definitely gives this device an edge over the other e-books.,217

I'm Italian and bake biscotti and have home made biscotti from family and Peggy's is my absolute favorite!

Also placed an order for a cousin out in California - Peggy you deserve more than a 5 star rating!",405
2,This is one of my all time favorites albums ever.A true masterpiece. The cd is full of great songs.This is a must buy for a true NIN and a good music fan.It deserves more than just 5 stars. The whole cd is pure genius.,218

2,"This has been a pretty good lens hood for me, the only drawback has been that when I shoot at 17 mm (using my 17-85mm Canon lens) the hood sometimes shows up in the corner of my photos. Perhaps it's because I'm not using a full-frame camera (I have a Canon 40D) or I have screwed it up somehow but it is an occasional problem. The hood seems very well-made, though, definitely a higher-quality construction than some non-Canon hoods that I have.",445
2,was just expecting a bit more video quality from the criterion blu rayhaving seen just how gorgeous their b&w; blu ray look...but anything else was top notchgive it a try; buy it if you can spared the money it worth it,218
2,"Best show in it's genre, be it Sci-fi, Drama, or adventure.It's premeire on DVD is long past due. Season One is the Best of Three. Blessed be to those that have past Jonathan Brandis and Royce D.

2,"We have had these sheets since the beginning of September. We have two dogs who jump on the bed often so I wash sheets every other day. No pilling,no fading. These sheets fit a king size bed that is at least 18 inches deep just fine. Just fit, no extra room. I always wash sheets by themselves and have NO problem with pilling. Be warned these really are BRIGHT PINK. Pretty but bright.",386
2,"In an era where gospel music imitates pop music instead of creating its own sound, this collection is outstanding! The Imperials prove why they have the sound and the message that no one else has been able to improve on.",220
2,Awesome. Gordon Parks is a quiet and little known American Icon. One that should never be forgotten.,100
2,"The dogs love it, but it chews down too fast and doesn't last long enough for what it costs to buy.",99
2,"So yeah this event was so-so but at least the DVD's are back to the way they were. I won't post the fights cos other reviews already have them. ALL fights are on one DVD while the other has the Countdown show, Backstage bonus, and the weigh-in show. Plus it has all the intro's to the fights and all the Rogan interviews post fights. Keep em coming like this and I'll be fine. Pre and post press conference would be nice too. Enjoy.",432
2,"I had this on VHS and just wanted to update, and although the DVD doesn't have a TON of extras, it's still really cool. It has some of the classic videos and then a little bio on the group. You can play the videos regular or with lyrics..I love these guys! =)",259

2,"I purchased this book to expand my teaching arsenal. It proved to be so well organized and comprehensive, I recommended it to several of my more advanced students.I encourage any teacher who is looking for a good all around reference book to check this one out.",261
2,"I purchased this book to understand a little of the process of designing and making a custom interior. The designs are good, but maybe a little dated. For instance, it's mainly street rods and no discussion of the newer 'pimp' style look. No AV system installs - which I was most intrested in finding how some of the flowing speaker enclosures are done.Very good photography throughout... you can pick some nice ideas if you're doing a street rod.",447
2,"My wife can't help constantly calling it the ""coolaroo."" It offers a nice, large shade area. It allows the breeze to blow through. Don't confuse this shade gazebo with other products that are designed to keep you dry. The coolaroo sure does cool-a-you...Love it!",262
2,I THOUGHT HIS LAST DISC WAS PRETTY Good.but this one is Better.it's More Rawer.You Can Hear THE Stevie Wonder&Sly Stone Influence all over this Disc.His Re-Make Of If You Want Me to Stay is Bumping With The GREAT GENIUS OF ROGER TROUTMAN on PRODUCTION.Spiritual Thang is The Cut.He is A Good Lyricist&THE Music Works Really well here.,334

2,Really nice support. I'm a 235lb man and is giving the support I need for my tranning. A little desappointed because I order 2 and the first shipment came with the thigtning knob broken; but hey no big deal I was able to put it in the door like it was suppose and have not gotten loose or nothing after all the pressure from my legs.Adjustable and a little tricky at the beggining in to how to put your feet against the door. Other than that no complains.,455
2,"Jack Kornfield is perhaps the most gifted meditation teacher in the West. His humor, compassion, clarity and insight make this tape series a life-long treasure. Perfect for anyone who is new to meditation or who wantsmore peace and compassion to stream from the heart.",268
2,"I watched this film for a class project reference. I read the play and, though the film shows us what the story is about, the play itself is far more interesting and intense. It doesn't stay true to the words 100%. I would recommend it to anyone.",246
2,"I have bought kitchenAid factory-reconditioned appliances before and have always been happy with their quality and value. This burr grinder is no different. It works as promised, looks great, and has a heavy high quality feel to it. I'm pleased.",245

Nothing can be as bad Honey Whitlocks day...being a bitchy film star can be boring after a while, but she gets back into the real world by getting kidnapped by a bunch looking like the misfits from your local mall in order to make an independant film with one message...Destroy!! The wonderful Alicia Witt is brilliant too as ex-porn star turned guerrilla fighter for the independant film industry..This film is hilarious, in very bad taste, sexy and fun.",482

2,"Good ""comeback"" album/cd. Homage to Honky Chateau's ML&MH & some other songs revisit his better period, although it would be a while before he did a good song end-to-end. This is seen by most as hist first true step back up.",224
2,"This is a book that every photojournalist, press photographer, or combat cameraman should own. The works of Tim Page, not only highlight the personl hell that or soldiers msut endure in a time of war, but also those journalist who risk thier own lives in order bring home the story of our brave men and women who fight for their country.",337

2,"I recently cut my hair and have found these brushes perfect to style my new hairdo. The large flat brush is great for lifting the roots and getting most of the moisture out of my hair. Next I go to the small round and turn under my short ends. Last I use the large round to give lift and body to the crown. My hair dries and styles quickly. I don't know if the Tourmaline is the real deal or just marketing, but I have to say that my hair does look shiney.",456
2,I ordered this case for my canon sd1100 and like it very much. But I found although it's a great case for protecting the camera itself it doesn't give you room for anything else.,178

2,"I bought this for my son about a month ago, and we LOVE it!!! He loves all the toys and can sit in there for up to an hour! He is a very curious baby and this helps with his curiosity!However this does take a while to assemble and if you're anything like me, the instructions won't help much, lol. But after all the pieces are put together, you'll see how awesome this really is! I just wish I could take this with me on our trips by plane. Anyway, this is a grea buy!",468

2,"I am a baker of artican breads. For convenience in mixing dough I usually end up baking two round artisan loaves at a time and have had problems with too-small, insulated baking sheets. For years I have overlapped two smaller cookie-type sheets. That worked but it meant that one of the loaves had to be baked right over the step where the top sheet ended. The Airbake Mega product solved the problem beautifully. Now both loaves have flat bottoms. It is big enough for two loaves but not so big that air circulation is blocked. A perfect solution.",548
2,"Beautiful book. Cover and art are incredible. Very proud to display in home. This is a great, quick read and this edition is very nice.",135
2,"I've read this book 5 times now, and when you finish it for the first, I'm sure you'll start reading it again! The plot is perfectly balanced, and with lots of twists and turns, you get to love Thomas Jefferson one minute and hate him the next. Mrs. Rinaldi knows how to write!!!",279
2,"I thought the book was well written and funny at the beginning, but at the end it became a little agravating. His humor used at the end came at the wrong times and kind of made your stomach turn. The book began as a light and funny comedy, but turned a touch revolting. The ending and beginning made up for it though so I gave it a 4 out of 5.",343
2,"After enjoying his ""Greatest Hits"" video and DVD for years, I was was concerned that this might be a disappointment. But was pleased to watch ""Hot August Night"" It may be his best. Keep it up Neil.",197
2,"I recently bought this cd and after having it for a few weeks it just seems to get better and better. The second cd is much mellower than the first, but the songs are well written and just seem to grow on you. It is one of the best cds I've ever bought. You won't be disappointed.Dave E",286
2,This item arrived intact and prior to promised date. Cannot comment on its content as it was a Christmas gift.,110
2,Came in the mail quickly and does what it is supposed to do. No problems with it. Shares the music for two!,107
2,"everything was as I expected and the product worked great and arrived in good shape, on time, and did the job I needed it to do",127
2,"this was good book.you can learn a lot.some of it is hard to remember,such as which type bonnet etc.but it was good.she could have even went into more detail of the mistreatment she felt she received from her family,but its the amish way not to offend.nadia rehmani -authoor of sharper than a two edged sword-one woman's walk into Islam and out.thats my story",359
2,"This cookware is on the heavy side, but no where near as heavy as cast iron! The heavy bottom provides even heating, and with the stainless steel lids you never have to worry about the glass lids chipping and getting glass in your food. I for one will never have cookware with glass lids! Being stainless steel, yes you will have problems cleaning it, but put water in the cookware and boil it and the stuck on food comes off easier.",433
2,"We purchased these sheets, due to Wal-Mart ( I hate that place) not selling king size ""T-Shirt"" sheets anymore.....why I dunno....ANyhoot...these sheets are the best we have ever bought.period...hands down....We are so amazed that Amazon.com had these for this incredible low price...amazing...we will definatly be back for more and more",337
2,My son is absolutely in love with his bus! It's the perfect size for his little hands. It is hands-down his favorite toy right now.,131
2,Gave it as a gift and she was very happy with it. I would recomend this DVD to the young and old!,97
2,"This product is the second Kindle for this family. The device is simple to use; and it is trivial to change font size, order new books and retrieve archived items.The best feature is that it is easy to read even in the brightest light.I love my Kindle!",252
2,"Any person looking to raise the level of their speaking needs to add this book to their library. I personally own every book Lilly has published. As a professional speaker myself and the author of, ""10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking"" (Warner Books), I appreciate the value of the information in Lilly's book and I recommmend this book to anyone.",353
2,"I have also owned these speakers for over 30 years. Paid 1200 for the pair, brand new and unfinished. Still own them. I can easily describe these speakers in one word....incredible.When you hear them, you will want them. You will do like I did....found a way to get the money together to buy a pair. If I could afford them, I would build an audio room and have a pair of Klipschorns in the corners. Best speakers in the world, in my opinion.",441
2,"After the first listen, I had almost no desire for a second. I guess I had my expectations for what a Son Volt album should sound like, and this went against my notions. A few months later I tried it again: hmmm, interesting. Some great parts stood out. Eventually it caught on, and now I'm in awe of this masterpiece. A common story for great works of art, and if you're looking for more under-appreciated masters, buy everything by Mark Linkous (Sparklehorse) and Ken Andrews (Year of the Rabbit, Failure, and solo works).",524
2,"Thankfully, I have not had an occasion to use these cables but it's nice to know that they're neatly packed away in my trunk should I need them. They're well made and come in a nice compact case. Just nice to know they're there.",228
2,This tweezer is the epitome of what a tweezer should be. It even comes with a little storage case. Can't wait for my next splinter...,133
2,These gloves work for there specific purpose I've had them for only two months and the strap is starting to tear. If you are into serious competition these aren't the gloves for you but for getting in shape and basic weightlifting they work fine.,246
2,Satisfied with the book. Many of the topics I relate to directly. I thought this book was accurately written for the most part and recommend it.,144
2,Just a great live performance that brought tears to my eyes. I recommend this CD to any Neil Young fans and also to those who may be too young to remember his past greatness. Sit back....light one up and bask in the music...Peace,229
2,"I realize that not everyone has a corny type of sense of humor like I do where you find silly movies like naked gun or nacho libre just full of laughs ..And Im not the type to rank movies but if you like those type of comedies im sure you will love weekend at bernies ..i literly couldnt stop laughing ..the plot, the scheming is so far out there it truly has 90 min of laughs and its a really enjoyable movie ..I dont usally buy movies anymore but I had to on this one..bottom line either way buy or rent it its a must see """,525
2,"You really can't beat it for the money. I use them while exercising cause they stay on very well, look good, and sound great (to me at least). The only issue I had was that the first 2-3 times I used them on the treadmill they would build up a static charge and shock me! I wasn't expecting that because this is my 2nd pair (first ones lasted 2 1/2 years). But I can run 45 minutes no problem now so it seems to have gone away, maybe they just need to be broken in a bit first?",477
2,"We bought four for our church. They were extremely easy to assemble, arrived promptly (free shipping) and were not even scratched in shipping. The chairs are sturdy and a wide-enough base to preven tipping. We will buy again.",225
2,"Watch out if you go on vacation with this book. I took Monti's book along with me on a trip. I ended up laughing out loud on the plane - more than once. And I don't usually burst into laughter while traveling alone. Every time I picked up the book I was glad I did, because Malcolm always ended up in an amazingly awkward situation. Sweep of the Second Hand is very refreshing and clever because the author described Malcolm's life in such a real way. I can't wait for Monti's next work. Who knows what he will think up next!",525
2,"This CD exemplifies the meaning of the words, classic, mellow, smooth and romantic. All I can say is PLEASE BUY IT! My favorites are ""Days Gone By"", ""Hurry Up This Way Again"" and ""Wise Ole Souls"". Anyone buying this CD will not be disappointed. ""Signature"" is a must have for your music collection.",298
2,This super thick book is packed with reproductions of various advertisements from the 60s. Each ad is wonderfully reproduced. Lots of memories will flood back if you are old enough to recall these products and their accompanying ads. Everyone else will simply enjoy how silly we were back in the 60s and how hip we thought we would be if we only owned these products. Especially hilarious are the ads predicting homes of the future! A truly outstanding compilation.,465
2,very nice product and nice company to buy from i will be back again thank you Avido Quinn,89
2,"King's ""On Writing"" is a must for any fan of his work, but especially for those who are fans and wish to write themselves. King begins with a short memoir describing his youth and the events and experiences that led to his interest in writing. In another section he gives writing advice and even includes part of one of his own incomplete stories, followed by corrections, and explantions. He finally discusses he near-fatal accident on a stretch of road.""On Writing"" reads like a novel, is entertaining and enjoyable to read. Recommended.",539
2,"I used these to remove my factory DIN radio in my Ford and it worked 100%, saved me a huge hassle of creating a removal tool with wire hangers, plus these are made in America unlike the Scosche ones made in China.",213
2,"Very well written. Its actually interesting to read!I am a bio major and i have to read a lot of these type of textbooks, this one is surely among the least boring and most to the point",185
2,"14 clear tracks. Our favs are Louis Prima & Louis Armstrong, #1& #2. They're upbeat, fast & different. Then it bogs down. Kind of loses the ""Swingin'"" concept and moves into a jazzy feel. But, still a good listen if you find a copy cheap enough.",245
2,"I read this book when I was youger, and it is still a book that I fall back to reading over and over. It is a quiet and calming book and McKenzie is an author with a dream. She is insperational in telling the tale from a females view point. I am now in university studying to become an English major, and in my books this is still the best book I have ever read. She brings you to the softer side of Camelot. This is the first book that brought me to love the Arthurian Legand. In my advice, it is a book worthy to anyone reading.",530
2,"I am giving this CD a 5-star rating. It has a wonderful selection of Christmas music, a celebration of Christmas away from the traditional, but meaningful just the same. I first heard the CD at a friend's home and decided to order several copies to give as gifts. Perfect for James Taylor fans and all music lovers!",315
2,I enjoy listening to this while I work because there are no words to distract me. Really nice background music.,111
2,The idea for the creature(s) is very interesting. The creature looks impressive and is freaky like you would expect. It's an interesting movie and it's one I will watch again. Is it great? No. But it is pretty good.,215
2,"I was skpetical about shelling out almost $100 for a table saw blade but had heard about the quality of Forrest blades. I must say, I have not been disappointed. Not only has the blade held a sharp edge, but most cuts come out so smooth that they do not require sanding. I had been using Freud blades but no longer. I find the Forrest blade far superior and well worth the price.",379
2,we got this for our lab and it is wonderful. it works well for us b/c we have a yard that is fenced on one side already. we put it in the crawl space and set it up so it would beep at the back of the yard and on the side of the yard that doesn't have a fence. we just set it up today. it took about a 1/2 hour to set up. we put it on level 4 for our lab and it was really strong so i put it back to level 3 and the regular size prongs instead of the long ones. he is getting it quite well! so much easier than digging! worth the price by far!,542
2,"I bought this on the same whim that lead me to buy Rx (seeing Martin Atkins' name on the back). I've never been much of a fan of any of the bands mentioned by the other reviewers, but I guess I don't need to be to say that this is very good stuff. It sticks to my brain like overcooked oatmeal.",294
2,It's too bad that none of them ever see Charlie but it's a terrific none the less. I Love Charlie's Angles!,107
2,"Nice carrier. Quite impressively made, seems very sturdy and tough, although I have not had the chance to try it out yet, but from what I can tell should work as a wonderful on board carrier for a puppy (which is what I am planning for) or a very small dog (like a chihuahua).",276
2,"THE BIG BOOK OF SUMO IS THE ONLY TRULY INFORMATIVE, ACCURATELY COMPILED, AND ACTUALLY RESEARCHED IN JAPAN BOOK ON SUMO THAT I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF READING.I PERSONNALLY GREW UP IN HAWAII WATCHING SUMO ON TV EVERY WEEKEND. I FOUND FACTS AND INFORMATION I NEVER KNEW ABOUT SUMO BEFORE. YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE AUTHOR AND SUMO ON THEIR OWN WEBSITE. SUMO.COM BOOK IS AGOOD READ AND YOU WILL LEARN SOMETHING.SCOTT IN LAS VEGAS",438
2,"Definitely for adults just as the book is. Terrific series, goes along most lines of the book, some deviations but mostly on key. If you like the books then you're gonna like the series.",186
2,These fit my 20 year old Panasonic. I was relieved to find belts still available. I would have given it 5 stars but 'love' for vacuum cleaner belts seems a bit much.,165
2,I enjoyed this book. I like reading Suzanne Brockmann's books. I was not impressed that the cover had changed and I purchased this book twice.,142
2,Very happy with this purchase. This is the second watch ordered over the last several years. I got this for my daughter and she didn't want another kind of watch...just this one! She is happy that we found it on Amazon!,219
2,A magnificent exploration of the underbelly of Japanese culture. One of our biggest selling books filled with rude pictures and miniturisation.,143
2,"After my one and only trip to a well know tax preparation service that left me quite unimpressed, I decided the next year to use Turbo Tax and have been using Turbo Tax ever since. So far it has helped me understanding and handling inheritance, mortgage and even a side business. I've been a little disappointed of late to see the company move away from their original willingness to stand behind their product if users were audited, to an additional service fee. About my favorite feature is the option to create a PDF file for your tax return.",545
2,I absolutely LOVE this coffee maker. I am a new mother working full time and I can't survive the day without coffee in the morning. My daughter just turned 5 months old and I have learned that I must simplify my daily routine wherever possible. This coffee maker is so convenient it has changed my mornings and there is no preparation needed the night before. Just refill with water every few days and it's always ready to go. LOVE IT!,435
2,"Whether you are a fan of Karl Richter's interpretation of Bach's music or not, these Cantatas are worth listening to.There are so many great solists that we can consider these recordings as historical.",201
2,"The songs on this CD are so different from the usual Bon Jovi music (which I love!) but it allowed Jon to go in different directions with his music. The songs are written with a great deal of observation of people and situations. The lyrics are poetic and personal. My current favorites are ""Every Word..."" and ""Staring at Your Window"" but all of the songs have something that grabs you and doesn't let go. And the heartache in ""August 7, 4:15"" is something that nobody should have to feel.",490
2,This was an emotional charged movie. It did answer a question that I had regarding the reason for the separation of church and state in Mexico. Mexico is a highly religious country and I couldn't remember why the separation. Gracias.,233
2,"As a craniosacral therapist, I am constantly on the lookout for music that does not interfere with a clients process and possibly enhances it. This album is exactly that. The music swims through the room as the artists dance together in simple and seemingly exquisite bliss. My clients love it and after I bought this album, I immediately bought it for my closest bodyworking friends.",384
2,"I've liked the movie Carrie ever since I was a kid and now that I'm older I feel that I can truly appreciate it for the horror classic that it is. The movie follows a young misfit by the name of Carrie White, who's constantly tormented by her peers. All she really wants to do is fit in, but her goal is seemingly an impossible one to reach because of her abusive mother and cruel schoolmates. The film is fantastic in my opinion and I think any one who views it will love it and start to sympathize with the title character.",525
2,"I'VE USED THIS SUPPORT FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. IT'S STABLE, ADJUSTABLE AND SMOOTH. I USE IT WITH MY DRILL PRESS, BAND SAW AND MITRE SAW AS IN-FEED AND OUT-FEEL ROLLERS, I'VE EVEN USED IT TO SUPPORT 4'X 8' SHEETS BEFORE RIPPING ON MY TABLE SAW. THEY ARE PLENTY STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ANYTHING I NEED TO DO IN MY WOODWORKING SHOP. THEY ARE WELL BUILT AND EVEN FOLD FOR STORAGE WHEN NOT IN USE. AN INDISPENSABLE ITEM FOR SAFE WOODWORKING. TWO THUMBS UP!...",452
2,"This is the best book, for many reasons, on the night the Titanic sank. It is expertly constructed and wonderfully researched - he had access to survivors in the 1950s. So many people agree it is superb - but there is a sequel - ""The Night Lives On"" - I would like to buy that, but where is it? Anyone know?",307
2,Very complete showing the diversity of the flora and fauna as well as the culture of Greenlanders. They are NOT Inuits! Greenland is a wild country--best stay close to what you know.,182
2,"Mine is a little paler than pictured, with darker markings, so the appearance is not as uniform. Tacky green felt comes off with the slightest provocation. I chose this over the RSVP grey one because this is a little smaller and I really wanted to be able to nestle in the palm of one hand, which it does fairly well because it has no pedestal base.",349
2,"I would recommend this book to anyone. It was a little drawn out in parts, but overall it was well written and a good, encouraging read.",136
2,I connected it to my new dehumidifier and it works like a hose!It does seem to be good quality hose and couplings.,114
2,"this product is very nice, but it caries a lot of weight and it can be a little loose, but still love it, it keeps the cereal crunchy though , so nothing to worry about",168
2,"Basil has done some great work but never has so much of his genius been enbodied in one single soundtrack that trancends the movie itself. The ""Civilisation"" piece was played at my Norse inspired wedding reception. Hardly historically acurate but who cares, it pumps with passion.",280
2,in 06 they let you do ajumping thing when your guy flipes in mid air. but you have to be running for awile and score a td. overall all the others who says the game sucks must be living in hole,192
2,This was the best book I've read in the historical romance genre. I have yet to read the book that tops this one except more Deborah Simmons. A delightful book that has you turning pages and loving every minute of it. I'd recommend it to anyone with a love for romance.,269
2,Great movie about the glorious year of 1999 in Dallas Stars hockey. This has been something nice to watch while waiting for this stupid lockout to end.,151
2,"This is the best Nilsson collection, becaause it is the only collection of Nilsson with the song ""Girlfriend"", a tune that became a theme song for The Courtship of Eddie's Father.",179
2,It's hard to believe this is a debut. These guys are dead-on and out of the old school of rock and blues. Very solid. They're getting a lot of love here in Philly. It will be exciting to watch them continue to grow.,215
2,"Ok, so I may not have a long history of listening to this band and Feel Euphoria is my first Spock's Beard CD, but let me say this. This is a great album. It has many influences and at points reminds me of other great progressive bands, like the Genesis of old. It's a shame there are not more bands turning out great music in a similar vain. If you like prog-rock you should love this CD. I do, and I'll be buying more by SB soon !",432
2,I love this series. BBC has the funniest programs and this one is one of the best. It keeps you laughing through every episode.,127
2,Great book. This one is a must have. It surely fits my top 3 next to Pit Bull and Darvas' book.You either like him or hate him but you can't argue with his record...,165
2,"the hernia belt does work . I am on my third day but there are adjustments , you will have too address and in my case some major modifications. one of the reviews suggested to buy on the large side and I did . I am 41"" on the fence between med and large so on the recomendation I chose the large. now I am forced to take about 4"" out of the belt",345
2,"What first got my attention was the author Himself, an impeccable warrior on the Toltec path.This book is an amazing compilation of Castaneda's legacy, presented in a nice indexed fashion, find X topic on X page of X book.So more than anything this is a huge bibliographic reference of Castaneda's books and for obvious reasons it'd would make a plus if you are familiar with at least some of them.",398
2,"These are not home security systems, they will not alert the police or alert any hub who will assist you... These will startle any intruder and give a resident forwarning that they may be in danger. The noise is loud and will arouse you from your sleep and certainly wake neighbors if close by. For what they cost they are effective and easy to install and set.For my home i live in a small town with apartments and townhouses in close proximity. They work great!",463
2,"It seems impossible, but Julia London just keeps getting better and better. This book enchanted me from the very first page. Adrian is a 'dark' hero to savor and yearn over. Lilliana is a delight and determined not to be ignored. Together they fight their way through to happiness and a most satisfying ending. This is one of those books you can't put down, then you are sorry it is over. I can't wait for the next book in this trilogy.",436
2,"I own 2 of these keyboards. The first one I used for three years before the ""v"" key stopped working...I never realized how much we use the letter v until that day. Anyway, the second is still going strong. I like the gentle curve over the more radical ergo keyboards.",267
2,"I read this book as a grad school and then used it many years later when teaching an undergrad seminar. I loved it, and the students did, too.The book is incredibly concise, clear. The book starts with the idea of concept and works its way (quickly) up to theories. Then the link between theory and empiricism is explored very briefly.If you have ever wondered what a ""theory"" is or by what criteria you could judge one, this is your book.",439
2,"Sager's cute voice is an acquired taste, but her songs are so outstanding, you will forget that Melissa Manchester and others performed them better. ""Moving Out"" is the funniest song about kicking someone out of your apartment you will ever hear and songs like ""Aces"" are the most tender and loving you will ever experience. Skip her follow-up disc and buy this one.",366
2,"I was very pleased when I opened the package and looked at the grill brush that I had purchased. It is well made with a hardwood handle (I think it is oak) with a rubber grip that covers a portion of the handle. The metal brissels are pretty standard for this brush but the weight of the brush makes it feel formitable in your hand. I have not used it yet as it is to late in the year to be grilling, at least for me. However, I would recommend this brush to anyone looking for a well made product.",498
2,a great book for father's day a. Any outdoors person concerned with nature and balance will love this book.,107
2,"you have the best price .seen this book at the store and they wanted more money for it.a friend told me to go to amazon and thats what i did ,so thank you",154
2,The new Canon battery seems to work fine. The delivery took several days even though I paid substantially extra for quicker delivery.,133
2,"I thought this was a wonderful book, both for reader and for writers. I am going to buy one for my brother now! And as for the imaginary places they left out, my guess on that would be that the people who own the copyrights on those imaginary places would not allow the author or publisher to include them in this book. I noted that although Xanth is not there (Piers Anthony), Neverwhere is (Neil Gaiman); they are both contempory authors and I think that just boiled down to permission. It seems that everything that is no longer copywrited is included.",555
2,"I alternately loved and hated this book. bell hooks makes me angry, but this book challenged my mind and my thinking. This is a must read for anyone seeking a solid foundation in feminist theory and writing. hooks explains the challenges facing black feminists like no one else can. While at times I do find flaws in her assumptions and logic, pushing the limits is the only way to secure positive change.",405
2,"I bought the Lexar Compact Flash reader based on my esperience with its SmartMedia twin, and I wasn't disappointed. Plugged into machines running Windows ME and W2000 it rapidly set itself up and was ready to go in under a minute. One caution: If you're running Window ME make sure you've got all the latest updates. Early version of Windows ME had a serious bug that caused problems in reading from any USB attached drives or other storage devices.",449
2,"what a wonderful first class mini series spanning two world wars and playing in some of the most exciting places in the states and europe. Hugh grant as Bruno , michael york and coutney cox are all superb, so is the rest of the cast, the story will keep you spell bound.another great book and movie from judith krantz",317
2,This is a fascinating exploration of the food business. A consumer must-see video. I have gone practically completely organic since viewing this.,145
2,Purchased these to use in outdoor pet beds. I was very surprised by how well these blankets work to reflect heat back.,118
2,"Simply superb - the acting, the screenplay. The set was simple and there were no CGI whatsoever. But the movie is so intense, engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable.",162
2,"I had low expectations for this book since so many Holmes pastches are uninspired ripoffs, but this turned out to be a clever and worthwhile surprise. There is a (mostly negligible) plot carried through the diary entries of Watson, but the real interest comes in the chronicled circumstances of the ""real"" cases behind the famous stories of the Canon, Watson's difficulties in pleasing his publisher and Holmes, and Holmes' ""true"" character and adventures. Well written and researched, and entirely ""plausible"" with respect to the Holmes cases.",544
2,"This is a ""new"" copy for me of a previous cookbook that was too worn to keep. I've used the cookbook for years. Basic recipes, lots of casseroles, desserts, etc.",161
2,I have used this laser level outside for landscape work. It's great for leveling stone walls and laying out small ponds. I use a camera tripod and have no trouble seeing the laser dot during daylight. It's a solid piece of equipment and you can't beat the price.,262
2,"This book has saved me a minimum of 6 trips to the vet. The most recent was last night, when a visiting dog was showing signs of what I feared might be bloat. It wasn't, and I was able to figure that out based on the information in this book.Every dog owner, not matter how experienced, will benefit from having this book close at hand. I plan to send a copy home with every puppy I breed.",389
2,"I discovered this c.d. at random in a used music shop.........I'm glad I did. It's a keeper! This is a great album to 'be with' when you're blue. Hazel expresses so much in her huge voice with careless statements like;""...starin' at that worn linolieum tryin' to trace the lost patterns 'round his tears...."" ""...we sometimes drive away the ones who care, from all the wearing and the tearing, the caring just walks right out the door.""I like a broad range of musical expression, but the cornerstone has to remain real people. You don't get any real-er than Hazel.",564
2,I had already owned the Panasonic system and bought 2 extra handsets to expand it My positive experience with Panasonic and Amazon made it a no brainer to buy them here.,169
2,I have had the pleasure to work with Mr. Malloy at several Junior Olympic camps in Florida. His insatiable desire to learn everything about shooting is cheerfully expressed in his work. His book covers critical aspects of shooting that would help every experience level. The book is concise and easy to read with photos and illustrations to help the reader. His friendly style is a bright contrast to the typical egotism developed by shooting authors.The book is highly recommended by a former Junior Olympic shotgun coach.,523
2,Edna Kramer gives such wonderful insight to mathematical evolution that she makes it come alive! To understand the struggles these math giants went through to solve problems that we now learn in a short time provides a real grasp of the solutions and how they came into being.,276

2,"It's a little hard to find this stuff in Northern California, so I had to buy it online. I had used boric acid on the quick little roaches in apartment before and known that it works wonder, so it's not like a surprise. But for the slow-and-bigger ground roaches, it seem to take a little longer to work as I have to put the power everywhere to cover their areas (I guess cuz they don't move around much or as fast as the other type).Shipping is a little high by all vendors, since amazon doesn't carry this stuff.",514
2,"This CD has all great songs! They all rock, and LTJ is the best! Buy this right now!",84
2,"This product is very low sugar, vegan and tastes incredible. The Seller ships fast and the product was perfect and exactly as described",135
2,The tenon cutter works very smoothly. I hadn't used logs as building materials until now and these tools made it a great thing to work with. I built a large arbor as my first project and I couldn't imagine trying to use any other tool. I purchased two cutters and will be purchasing others.,290
2,"The fight scenes were actually realistic. You know Gina can fight in real life, so you don't have that ""she can't do that"" thing going. Three Hollywood A listers and a bonifide female action star. Gina's acting wasn't bad. It wasn't great either, but this is her first film. And I'm assuming she's had zero acting experience. And the fight scene with young Magnito was awesome! Worth the rent, worth the theater, worth buying as well.",434
2,it was a little tricky figuring out which size replacement beaker i needed for my french press. i used the Bodum website and information from the Amazon reviews to pick this size and it fits perfectly. now i'm caffeinated again and life is good.,245
2,"The Triple Concerto is a beautiful masterpiece and this rendition and recording is quite stunning. The 10th Symphony, though less well-known and perhaps less a masterpiece, is also quite appealing. Any Beethoven fan would be happy to own this CD.",246
2,"Lots of innovative ideas for mixing learning with playing. My husband and I read and sing to our daughter constantly. But with help from this book, we have integrated interactive play while reading and singing, and she has responded with pure glee. It may all sound scientific but in fact the book takes a simple, hands-on approach to learning mixed of course with love from you. So grab this book, get down on the floor and get going because you will be shocked at how your child will respond and how you will then respond to her and so on and so on.",551
2,"Blue is such an awesome song, the first time I heard it I was stuck to it and I kept playing it over and over. I just want to jump up and dance to it. Its a definate listen to-buy c.d. and i luv the techno-sound and beat. !",223
2,"I've seen a lot of people echoing my opinion that this is a true standout album. It is easy to forget that these are all B-sides since the quality of the songs is as consistant as any of Oasis' album.The Masterplan is a great album to listen to beginning to end since the songs all have a different feel and sound to them.If you don't like Oasis, this album won't change your opinion. If you do like Oasis, The Masterplan probably provides the most quality music per dollar of any Oasis album.",493
2,"This book is a clear, insightful and, yes. brilliant marketing guide. It is suitable for the most experienced and sophisticated business leaders, as well as a primer for business beginners. The author, Celia Rocks, knows her subject and communicates her ideas with detailed examples. Brilliance Marketing Management is innovative and inspiring. I recommend it highly.",367
2,"Slim Fast is a great product, and the mix here is no different. Buying this is a great value over the stores.It tasted great, like chocolate milk, not the Protein Flavor so many have come to expect.Buy this, and drink happily.",226
2,"I bought this pan for Thanksgiving for making a particular dessert recipe that required a 9-inch square pan. I read the reviews here and knew it might be too small (and it was), but I thought it was so pretty that I could use it for other things if not for the dessert dish. It really is a beautiful pan, but the one I received has a sort of pinkish tinge to the beige. I have other LeCreuset products, and none of them look quite like this.It's still pretty, though, and heats up well for cooking.",498
2,This is just like the one that broke. Of course that one lasted for 3 years with daily use. Good luck with your purchase.,121
2,I liked this series. Interesting to think of the position of second sons in our society thru the lens of this story. Writing was fine and would make a good movie.,162
2,Could not find them in the local stores. This was an easy way to get them without traveling many miles.,103
2,"My husband searched for years to find any ladder without plastic on top. Welding spatter melts right through plastic tops and sometimes erupts in flames! Problem solved. Strong aluminum top, sturdy 2 sided ladder for more productive setup and working completes the job more efficiently! Its a little bit heavy but that's an acceptable trade off for sturdiness.Only con with ladder- After 10 years or more the fiberglass is starting to becomeweathered from being in the sun and ultraviolet light from welding and is very itchy when touched with skin!",549
2,"I have to be honest, I haven't done much more than leaf through this magazine and look at the pictures. I have been too busy for the past six weeks or so. I will say that some of the stuff looks yummy, so I have saved them and plan to dive back in when life slows down.",269
2,"This was possibly one of the best groups to play in the 90s. Unfortunately, they broke up before they produce their second album. If only they would magically appear on stage again, I'm sure that the world would accept them back in the spotlight of the music industry. Maybe we'll all be blessed that one day they will get back together again and grace our ears with their music.",379
2,Dennis the Menace is a classic comedy about a kid who gets in a lot of trouble. And him and his neighbor have a rivalry against each other. And dennis ends up having to live with him.This is a joyous comedy with many twists and turns that happen.,246
2,I just seen this book in my roommates room and I became curious. I grabbed it and starting reading it to see how well it might help. With carefully reading this book I was able to recite all 50 states and in order. This book links words and thoughts of images that all relate to each other. I recommend this book if you would like to learn of different techniques to help improve memory. This just needs to be practiced often so it can become long term use.,457
2,"It was time to replace my 25 year old Technics towers. I wanted something much smaller, without giving up the great sound I was accustom to. I listened to a lotta speakers from Bose, Wharfdale, Polk, and for the money, these were by far the best. Good bass, crisp highs & rich midrange sound. I'm very happy with these & I hope they last as long as my last set.",361
2,"get this cd. badi's guitar playing is excellent and this cd is moving and relaxing, energizing and inspiring.",109
2,The pen arrived on time and was packaged extremely well. When setting up my tablet to recognize the pen new software appeared that allowed me to customize more than I had before. I suspect my old pen would have done the same but I never bothered to look.The pen is working well for my work in 3D Studio Max as well as Premiere Pro. It seemlessly detects which program I'm in and allows me to use the functions I need.,417
2,"In this case, the book was based on the movie that preceded the book. I loved the movie, and I couldn't wait to read the book - and I wasn't disappointed.An easy read that combines a great story, just enough religious information focused on Latter Day Saints activities involving religious missions, families, and homophobia. It involves a gay character, a coming of age story, and a coming out story.A nicely written book that is a fun read. I certainly would recommend it to both teens and adults.",499
2,"This album is great w/out a doubt! If you like old school death metal w/ a touch of maturity & flawless production, then this album is for you! I've only heard bits & pieces of Severe Torture's other works, but they don't compare to this album especially in it's production & sound. Don't be afraid to give this album a try!",324
2,"I enjoyed watching Season Three as it was originally broadcast, but find the commercial free video much better. Especially being able to become fully emersed without interuption. Great series. Can't wait till Season Four is available for purchase. Too bad that will be the last season.",285
2,"This book is book three in Sonrise Farms series. Book four is now available too (MORNING GLORY). This horse series is awesome. My nieces love them. The books are full of adventures about Jenny and her palomino horse that all girls 10-15 love. The stories are wholesome and have a morale lesson. They also offer a Christian perspective, which I appreciated. It is hard these days to find wholesome reading for kids.",414
2,"I am glad I read this. I tend to usually not get into reading plays, but I did enjoy this one. It is haunting and is not a feel-good read, much like the movie. However, there are some lines in this that just grab you. The constant question of what defines love, sex, and happiness is very thought-provoking. Can love just stop in a single moment?",346
2,This is an awsome CD I hightly recommend it. All of the songs on this CD are great.,83
2,"It opened me the door to the world of understanding the interpersonal communication, understanding my own feelings, desires, needs,...I read a lot of John Powell's other Books (this was my first) and they all impressed me and helped me a lot by personal growth. I found in them a lot of answers or confirmations of my feelings or thoughts, I felt I am not alone,... They helped me to see a direction when having problems in my relationships,... So i consider it for a great honor, to be able to write a review first...summary in few words: ""Thank you, John Powell!""",565
2,"I use this product with my 15"" MacBook Pro. After reading review about laptops falling off lower priced stands I decided to shell out the extra cash and purchase this one and I couldn't be happier with it. It's a perfect height, feels very solid and helps keep my cables organized with the hole in the back. The little rubber bumpers keep your laptop from getting scratched while on the stand. I really have nothing negative to say.",432
2,Love it! Great piece of writing by Kathryn Lasky she kept me engaged and dying to read the next book in her already amazing series. All in all great plot details and personality of characters,191
2,"I have never had a problem using the Verbatim DL discs. They prove to be very reliable (over my 3 years of experience with them.)The last batch I bought was a 30 spindle and it was 8X speed, I ran them reliably at 6X. I do not see anything on the label of 96577 that states its reliable at 2.4-6X (my packaging states 2.4X only) I have been running them at 2.4 which slows the burning process a little.I may have received the tail-end of older stock? I just don't know. The discs preform well.",493
2,I haven't finish it yet. It seems to be easy to understand and practice. But I am not sure if it effect every type of child.,124
2,I bought these pants for my boyfriend because he works outside in the construction field. He says he absolutley loves them! Very comfortable and plenty of room to move around. Woud strongly reccomend these to people who work hard outside and need good quality work pants for a decent price.,290
2,Soft and cuddly and just the right size for my 18 month old grandson. He tucked it under his arm and carried it everywhere and it's safe to use at bedtime in the crib.,167
2,"This is a masterpiece from start to finish, and a must for your modern-classics DVD collection. It was one of the earliest films that I managed to see, and Ben Cross still personifies courage under adversity for me. Wonderful to see how two very unlikely individuals became heroes. And the Vangelis score... powerful, even today. Still, I agree with earlier reviewers that a letterbox format would heighten its effect more than the wide-screen. Especially those big-vista scenes when the runners are practicing-- they'd have much more of an impact.",548
2,"This weighs our weight just fine, but is off on my fat %. It weighs my husband's % correctly. The problem I have is that I'm dehydrated and it shows my percentage being 5% more than the calipers (gym employee tested) show. So just bear that in mind (the directions give you all that info).",289
2,"In this book Bill Henson manages to capture the essense of children and the men they call father. Each photograph (taken by Bill Henson) is a moving photograph of a father and his son(s), accompanied by a essay written by the father, son, or both. There are some celeberties in the book which is an added incentive to buy, but the best reason to buy this book is because of the fantastic artwork done by Bill Henson and the touching essays that capture the love between a father an soon.",487
2,"I love this chain! I love it because it's sturdy enough for be to sleep in and wear it everyday, but it's not bulky. It's a very simple and classy chain which is exactly what I wanted!!",185
2,"Not even in the same class as her historical romances like Whitney, etc. but very entertaining. Not much romance as I would have liked, but it was a great listen (Audio Book while I drive) and you end up getting sucked into the story and Mitchell and Kate's love story. Typical McNaught misunderstandings cause some frustration, but as always it's worth it in the end.",368
2,"Sula, a book that talks about the issues of being a black women is a really good novel to read.One of the reasons I recommend it is because of its realism and its themes - death, sex, friendship and poverty.I also think that its characters are very good, its easy to identify with one or both of them. I really recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature.",368
2,This is a wonderful movie to watch over and over again.. I just do not need to own it right now.. maybe later,109
2,"I think the cd is a quality project. since 18 yrs QR has endured time, lineup changes, diff producer and label. NO one wants a carbon copy of the old.The one thing that i like most about the album are the lyrics. QR is back and they proved they can bring back II in a big way!",276

2,Hands down - the best battery operated toothbrush for the money. This toothbrush excelled at cleaning my teeth & it uses a simple AA battery. I bought this toothbrush for around $20 and used it well over the recommended life of a toothbrush. Will it last forever? No. Should you really expect it to? Of course not.,314

2,"Well, This following the essential 50's and 60's, is a excellant representation of the Kings final decade, from tear jerker ballads, to country, to pure rock n roll, This time period is ofte underrated, but produced many great songs for the King.An Awsome live disc displays some killer tuens and great versions of classic songs, definatly a must!!",348
2,"I bought the stand used but when it came it looked brand new. It tilts a little, but other than that it is a sturdy professional stand.",135
2,"This is a terrific disc, good recorded sound, nice instrument by Clementi's piano company, and interesting music also, which is seldom recorded.Amazon - please fix the description however, it is Clementi (Composer), John Khouri (Performer), not ""Busoni; Godowsky (Composer), Carlo Grante (Performer)"".",301
2,"I'm fairly sure this CD is the same as the original LP, which was released around 1967. After over 40 years I still remember that the end of the LP contained a medley of Mancini's themes, which were beautifully arranged and performed. I hope this CD is going to be re-issued at a reasonable price someday. As I recall, Mancini conducted the Philadelphia Pops for recording the LP.",380
2,It was a Christmas gift and greatly appreciate. The recipient had it on his lift of favorites for purchase and has enjoyed it greatly.,134
2,"My kids love this movie. I have a toddler & an elementary student. When they are allowed to watch it, they watch it over and over until they fall asleep. I had to limit their movie time because they only wanted to watch this movie and nothing else. They have been watching this movie since it originally came out. They still love it. If I need to clean up or make them stay settled for a while, I put on this movie and they do not move!",436
2,Nicely made set. They are perfect for my uses in wax or clay... I have looked for years for something like these... Nicely made set.,132
2,"Schwensen's business-like nature is sometimes annoying. He name-drops a lot and fawns over the genius of Carrot Top, offering as evidence of his creativity the fact that he makes money. But if you can supply the artistry, Schwensen definately knows the business. He has a lot of direct, useful information about how to market your act at all levels of competition, from novices to headliners.",392
2,"Awesome album! I had to buy it because its the only compact disc that had Avlin Robinson's ""down home girl"". Not to mention so many others like Robert Parker who's stuff is all vinyl too. For someone who doesn't have a record player but want's to rock to some rare motown classics. YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS!",305

Trying to find another of this same unit!",300
2,"This ground beef mix makes for a delicious and quick meal. You can use it to make Cuban picadillo. But, I've used the mix to make empanadas (beef turnovers), Spanish-style meatloaf, and even a zesty cottage pie. The ingredients are all natural and taste absolutely fresh.",271

2,"This is my new workhorse and the price is incredible! You can use it to fry, saute, boil-- make stews and then you can put it lock, stock & barrel into the oven. Thank you Caphalon and thank you Amazon!! I bought another Caphalon skillet at TJ Maxx about a year ago and it was in NO way as good quality as this one. Being a new Mum on a budget, I can really appreciate buying these quality cookware pieces one at a time. You won't regret adding this one to your collection!",473
2,"Am very pleased with it and my daughter loves it. Recommend you put a towel underneath because of the water, but what's a little spilled water compared to making your child happy.",179
2,"This was a one of the better books in the Jedi Apprentice series. It shows lots of Obi-Wan's thoughts and how he works. You can pass on this book if that is what your heart desires, but people who want to really get into the Jedi Apprentice's, should definetly read this one. It has minimal action, but plenty of suspense you keep you reading.",343
2,"My wife is a formally trained Chinese chef. She frequently uses the first one of these we bought. We've had it for about 2 1/2 years and it has held up to all that use quite well. I recently bought her a second one after finding it on Amazon at a greatly reduced price. It is still in the box, held in reserve for the day when she needs it. The price was great, and the delivery prompt.",386

2,"Audioslave is one of the few good merger bands. Taking Chris Cornell and throwing in Rage Against the Machine band members was a great idea. With this album, you get the same great riffs that Rage Against the Machine fans have come to expect, mixed with a different flavor of vocals. While the rapping vocals of RATM's Zach de la Rocha definitely will be missed, Chris Cornell pulls through with his awesome voice.",414
2,"Haven't had time to make many of the recipes yet, but the book is quite interesting, and I'm looking forward to trying many of the recipes.",139
2,"I found this biography of John Quincy Adams's Life to be very in-depth and interesting. It was written well and helped me with a leadership essay I had to do on him. The childhood of Adams set the scene for a greater understanding shaping his persona and actions later in life. I had little knowledge of Adams' before reading the book and once I finished, I felt I knew him and felt sorry for the sacrifices he had to give up due to his family name, plus the expectations his parents layed upon him.",499
2,"The text is wonderful and informative. The reason I gave it a four star rating instead of five is that I would like to have seen the illustrations in color, but don't let that stop you from getting this great book. As stated by Patrick O'Brian in the Forward of this book ""You name it, Nelson's Navy has it.""",308

2,"I have had many a coffee maker over the years and this is by far the best. I went with Cuisinart as I have been very pleased with previous Cuisinart purchases. They didn't disappoint me this time either. The coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee. It's easy to fill, easy to clean. I was thrilled with my savings over the department store price.

2,"I bought this scale to keep careful track of a family member's weight after she had major surgery. It was important to be able to see even the slightest weight gain, and this scale does just that with the increments it shows.",225
2,"While I am a fan of Ms. Potter's books, this third book in the series was not the best of the lot. Usually the third book in a series of three, is always the best since it ties up loose ends carried through the previous books and allows us to find out how the previous books's couples are doing. I just wasn't as excited about the characters. It was still a better-than -average read and I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it. I rate the first two books as 5'sand enjoyed the series as a whole.",501
2,This is the best album I have purchased this year. Hands down. The musicianship on the whole album is flawless. I bought the album and right after listening to it for the first time bought tickets to their upcoming show. If you like metal you will not be dissapointed.,268

I might not suggest it for the very beginner yogi, but this is a great dvd!TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION",315
2,"Nicholas Sparks has such a wonderful gift for making a reader feel every emotion possible. I laughed, and mostly cried through this whole book. But don't misunderstand, it was the kind of cry that makes you feel so good afterwards. The spiritual emphasis in this book was something I enjoyed very much. It is going to make a great Christmas gift for all of my friends!",368
2,This is a great book for quilters at any experience level. The projects are small but useful. Debbie Mumm has many quick tips that make your projects come out looking like you have been quilting for years. This was my first experience with strip quilts and speed triangles. The instructions are clear and concise with diagrams to make it easy.,343

Know the person behind the jokes, the puns and the punch lines. It's not all laughs, you know.",440
2,"Wow, what a great book. Instant classic that I will probably revisit in the future. It was pretty much the adult version of a modern day 'Lord of the Flies.'",157
2,"This is David Lynch's film school final project, and is legendary for its humor, bleakness and impressive special effects for The Baby. Stop looking here if you want to buy it & go to Lynch's website - that's the only place where it's available, and it's not Amazon cheap, either. It takes a very special type of personality to enjoy this movie - if you didn't like Blue Velvet for its weirdness, stay FAR away from this one!",425

2,"This is a thoroughly research piece of work and effectively dispels the mythology surrounding Robert Stroud. The author writes in a lively and engaging style. As other reviewers note, though, the work is much in need of editing. It features occasional incorrect word usage, mistakes in punctuation and problems in sentence structure. These are particularly notable in the book's early chapters. Despite these flaws, it's an empirically sound work that will answer your questions about the sad case of Robert Stroud.",515

The STI shifters cost over 100 dollars. Of course at a bike shop u could find better bikes, but not a road bike, under 500. In short, for the most part and the money this is an outstanding Road Bicycle.",366

2,"I have read quite a few of the newer Sanders novels and liked them. This was the oldest of his that I've read (copyright 1978). The antagonist is motivated by a subject matter that has been the centerpiece of two new novels I've recently read.The main character, Samuel Todd, shares some of the same traits as Archie McNalley, another Sanders character in a different series. This story and Todd are a bit darker than McNalley, though. See why Sanders comes by his good reputation by reading this book.",502
2,"We read 6 books on the Big Island before going there (I know, a little compulsive). This one is helpful, but really the only two books you need are: Hawaii The Big Island Revealed by Andrew Doughty and Adventure Guide Hawaii The Big Island (Hunter Travel Guides) by Bryan Fryklund & Jen Reeder. The Fryklund/Reeder book is absolutely jam-packed with information. The Doughty is also packed with info and will have a few things the Fryklund book doesn't have, but it's main attribute is that it is an absolute joy to read.",521
2,I THINK KIMBERLA LAWSON ROBY HAS OUT DONE HERSELF THIS TIME. THE BOOK WAS EXCELLENT. JUST WHEN YOU WOULD THINK THAT CURTIS BLACK WAS FINISHED FOR GOOD HE COMES UP WITH ANOTHER PLAN OR SCAM....THE BOOK IS OFF THE CHAIN AND YOU HAVE TO READ CASTING THE FIRST STONE TO GET THE FULL EFFECT OF THIS BOOK.,299

2,"What makes these stories work is the voice. There is a clear authorial voice here, one which remains familiar without becoming grating. Occasionally the stories miss the mark (""The Wavemaker Falters"") but mostly they're dead on. Saunders manages to convey a sense of melancholy and decay that's just perfect.If you came to buy this collection after hearing ""Offloading for Mrs Schwartz"" on This American Life, hesitate no longer. Buy the book.",443

""Cities"" is perhaps my favorite dance tune ever, and ""Heaven"", ""Memories Can't Wait"", and ""Life During Wartime"" are all classics. This album, however, is not as consistent as ""Buildings and Food."" Also, the juxtaposition of tunes sometimes seems odd.Highly recommended, but ""Buildings and Food"" is a better choice for someone looking to buy their first Heads album.",476
2,Excellent series so far. Let's hope Martin doesn't drag this out like Jordan's facial expression epic: WOT.,107

2,"I was pleased to stumble across this entertaining horror gem! I liked the fact that it didn't contain lots of in vogue gore which made a refreshing change from the majority of horror films of late. I'm sure it will not go down in history as a classic of the genre and perhaps I'd of given it 3 stars but for the great twist at the end, well worth the extra star! Worth a watch, there are worse movies than this, ""The Grudge"" for example!",437
2,"I bought these for my brother that is a piolet, and he loved them. Recommended to buy with polarized lens, you can tell the difference.",135
2,This book was really good from the start. It gave me new insights about myself and about the opposite sex. I would say it is a must have for any relationship. It can help make things work or make things work better.,215

2,"We thought the remastered editions of Episodes IV-VI were fabulous! Not only were the films clearer and sharper than they ever were, the subtle additions of deleted scenes made the whole re-seeing all that much more spectacular. My husband and I saw the originals when they first hit the theaters over 27 years ago. It was great to see them restored so well. We especially loved the end of Eps. VI where Hayden C. was placed next to Yoda & Obi-Wan in spirit form. It just made the melding of Eps. I-III with IV-VI all the more complete.",536

2,This cd is an excellent addition to anyone who owns and loves the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials. My children loved to hear the music from the shows they had watched.,166
2,"I would give this book 4 1/2 stars if I could, it was so much fun to read. I was pleasantly surprised at every turn and just thoroughly enjoyed this book! Nonnie St.George has a great sense of humor and for a first book, plot, characters and dialogue were all excellent. I look forward to reading more of her books and with a bit of polish, I'm sure her next ones will all be 5 star rated.",389

2,I ordered this for my son before christmas this came quick and works great!! Thanks u so much for everything. I would recommend u to anyone..,141
2,"Very original movie, but there's a lack of detail. A lot of questions remain unanswered, where they should be answered. For instance, why are the people in the CUBE and who put them there? To be short: Cool effects, medium acting, great setting, not so well thought over.",271
2,I have read this book twice. It really helps in understanding the different personality types and the way they think and communicate. A great read for even the work environment. I highly recommend it.,200
2,"I bought this picture for someone who is a customer where I work, and we both think the quality on it is marvelous. This is a photographic reproduction of an original antique photo, blown up to portrait size and tinted in rich earthtones. It would look great matted and framed, which is what he's planning to do with it. This comes also with a printout biography page about Padre Pio. A five-star product you will love!!",420
2,"My son absolutely loves this and our youngest daughter is intrigued. I guess I have the older version. but this is great game for kindergarden and below. I guess the newer model its not as loud. that is the only knock i have on it, if someone in the room wants to watch the boob tube and not read subtitles or wear headphones.Its fun and my boy doesn't get upset when I beat him, he understands luck is involved. We repick our color right before we start each game, so that don't subconsciously cheat setting up the next game.",526
2,Pope Benedict address the problems of the day in a forthright manner. For the faint of heart who want writer to gloss over our troubles and offer panaceas this is not your book. But I like the honest discussion and his compassion for humanity.,243
2,"Honestly the best travel book series ever. It is written by someone who does not get paid from any organization in Hawaii to promote their products. It is straight forward and to the point. Gives tons of ideas on where to go, what to do, where to eat, and so on. It was our Hawaii encyclopedia both times we went to Maui. Visiting the Main Island next year, and I WILL purchase Hawaii Revealed for that trip.",408
2,I loved the movie Sleepy Hollow as I did to the timeless classic by Washington Irving. But the music is what really brings out the terror in this wonderful soundtrack. I loved every minute of the music because it is spooky and all Elfman. Few people realize what elfman is capable of making.,291
2,"It's great, haven't had a problem, travel size and good fidelity, feels smooth and runs flawless on almost any surface.. cool!",126
2,"When I read the description it mentions being able to personalize your workouts. I thought, ""Yeah, right."" But you really can pick and chose and combine what you want. You can combine high intensity arms with low intensity abs and medium intensity cardio. It is up to you. Or you can choose from the basic low, medium, or high intesity workouts. This is a great workout DVD and Denise is pretty easy to follow for the most part. I'd recommend it for anyone of any workout level who wants to exercise in the privacy of their own home.",533
2,watched this on the ps3 app...streamed nicely and was an entertaining movie...if you have seen the previews you probably have a pretty good idea whether or not you will want to see this movie...there is a lot of humor and some action...,236
2,"Got this for my 5-year-old shortly before kindergarten was to start (he kept telling me he wasn't going). He really enjoyed it and had us read it to him repeatedly. I think anything that helps dispel the mystery of what to expect in kindergarten is great, and the illustrations in this are cute.",295
2,I sent this to my Grandson. He is not yet walking but it had been recommended to me by an early childhood learning teacher who had given one to her Granddaughter who is now almost 4 years old. It looks very sturdy and now that he is beginning to pull himself up and get ready to walk I am sure that it will be an invaluable toy/walker.,335
2,i think that pursia is one of the cutest baby ponyz. its fun because you can style her hair and use her for your bratz big baby the baby doesnt really fit her legs over her back though that would be really cool,210
2,"The unvarnished account of serial killer/rapist Keith Hunter Jesperson. Olsen, the dean of American true-crime writers, presents a well-researched portrait of a monster. Jesperson's excuses and bragging are included in the narrative, which can be off-putting, but Olsen is simply doing his duty, giving the reader all available information about his subject. While not quite as satisfying as his masterpiece, MISBEGOTTEN SON, I: THE CREATION OF A SERIAL KILLER is a still a worthy addition to Olsen's canon.",507
2,"This is the first cd that inroduced me to dj dara. It kicks really hard and the bass drops like no other. It is great to listen to when you just want to sit back and go into a daze. I thought the vocal samples were pretty decent (check out the last song, suicide) and overall a pretty good cd to check out",305
2,"I purchased this based on other reviews, and have found that it is perfect for pet grooming. We had a Greyhound, just passed away in January of 07, and his nails were very hard to clip, so I purchased this and used the very fine grinder barrel and his nails were done so quickly.He barely flinched and his nails looked really nice.",331
2,"Just want to recommend this book, I actually enjoyed it more than the others. Well told, and after reading the other books in this series, you are really feeling like you know the characters and can identify with them. The very end is wonderful, and I can't wait to read the next.",280
2,"I recently began experiencing tendon/CTS pain, especially at night. I did some research and bought this brace. I absolutely love it. I have small arms/wrists and this splint fits perfectly. The first night I wore it I did not wake up once in the middle of the night to write pain. It allows enough movement of my fingers such that I'm wearing it now as I type. I couldn't be happier with this product.",401
2,"My husband loves glycerin soaps. They have become difficult to find and it is great that Amazon carries so many. Glycerin soaps clean well, moisturize without leaving a film on your skin. Many come sented. Pears has a clean scent that doesn't linger. Glycerin soaps will disentigrate in water but these bars are nice and big and hold up well just don't leave under running water.",379
2,"There are so many great tracks on this CD, but if only for ""A Certain Smile"", you should buy it...this track alone is worth it.",127
2,every song is meaniful. there is just so much in the words is like riding on an emotional roller coaster but to the point and so real. SOUVENIRS!!,146
2,"Airport Terminal Pack is a good value if you like movies from the 70's. I personally purchase more classic and older movies than I do current titles. The original Airport was kind of a yarn for me, but I did enjoy the remaining three: Airport '75, '77, and '79.",261
2,"Not PC humor of the 70s, still entertaining after all these years. Like a good suit, quality transcends the generations.",120
2,OMG! I am a Glee addict! I had only caught a couple episodes on tv and liked it. But I aboslutely love this show! I wish I could break out in song and dance all day long. :),173
2,"Wasn't sure how this would work out, took over 600 pictures with this lens on my Canon SLR EOS Rebel. Was shooting a Hockey Tourney over the very weekend I got it, Every picture was great, The delivery was the as usual 2 day service from NYC NY. to PEI Canada. Will be using this company for all my future online shopping needs.",328
2,"THESE LAMPS ARE JUST BEAUTIFUL - SOFT, BUT ADJUST UP FOR READING VERY PLEASED AND RECEIVED IN RECORD TIME",105
2,"This is a classic ethnography of the Shuar, the one that established the standard for all subsequent descriptions of the Shuar. I have done extensive field work with a Shuar related group and was impressed on how accurate Harner's account was, even though the group I worked with was separate in both time and space from the untsuri shuar. This is a must read for anyone interested in the ethnography of lowland South America.",426
2,"I ordered this thing about a month ago. It came in the mail not long after that. I installed it, and it works.",110
2,This are great running bras for women with C and larger. The easily adjust. I have worn them for years and my only complaint is that they don't come in a smaller band size. They do run true to size.,198
2,I am useing the RTV-44 as a surround set to compliment my Bic DV 62 mains and Polk Sub.They are driven by Sony STR DH 810 Receiver. They sound Great!,149
2,I use this item religiously and got this one for my granddaughter who has braces. Biggest problem is the breaking hose problem but have now found replacement items on Amazon so it's not such a big deal. I do feel that WaterPik could easily correct this problem with a small spring stiffener at the handle if they wanted to but they probably would not sell as many units.,370
2,Every bit the keyboard as my old Microsoft. The media/net buttons at the top aren't quite as easy to hit as those on the MS keyboard but they aren't annoying in any way.,169
2,"We saw this movie over a year ago. My husband said he would like it for his DVD collection and I waited until it came down to a phenomenal low price ($5.) It was a ""bonus"" Christmas gift that he didn't expect.",209
2,"This was an absorbing story, with some ironic twists and one of his best evil antagonists.",90
2,"This is an excellent docudrama that serves as one of the all time great case studies in Leadership. Rarely in the history of man is there a more impressive example of leadership during a crisis. Shackleton's twenty-two month journey is a testament to the importance of values, vision and mission. This video is a just presentation of Shackleton's unbelievable accomplishments.",376
2,"Hunter Wayward is way cool!!! Visited the gaming site and was blown away. I really like the character line-up, it is almost as the characters actually really do exist...heheh My favorite character so far is Kassandra Cheyoung. She looks like a tough chick who can kick some ***!!!!",281
2,"Excellent product, excellent price very satisfied with the quality of the product. i plan to buy again any time soon.",117
2,Bruce Lee is awesome! A good movie. Quality is as good as the original film. A must-have for Bruce Lee fans!!,109
2,"This is BUBBLEGUM. But it's not your usual. it's much catchier with better lyrics! (Why ya wanna call me on my phone, every time you see another boy in my home, but boy, you should have thought of that before, now you wanna come home and you're alone, just hte same ol same ol sad scenario, every time you say you wanna be someone, etc.) I can't wait for the album.",365
2,"I never bothered with the HBO series, but the dvd is all you need to watch the whole thing and make more sense than the dribs and drabs of weekly tv. Perfect casting and great acting all around, especially Piven as the agent Ari Gold. Nice soundtrack, though the Rolling Stones circa 68 are a bit over-used at times. Looks like a Scorcese drama, but it's actually Mark Walhberg's work. Very much worth watching.",411
2,"Once you get to grips with the (Bolshoi) excercises being described in measures rather than counts it's a wonderful resource for the serious teacher and adolescent student. There are lots of clear(if old fashioned) photos: Plisetskya and a young Maximova included. This book should be on every ballet teacher's bookshelf, along with theory books relating to Cecchetti, Kirov and English schools of training... A serious book for passionate bookworms like me.",458
2,This is the most helpful book I have ever read in sorting out the complexities of relational database design. Most books tell you how to use the software but not the basics of design. I was able to put together a fairly complex database - and my relationships work - just by using this book!,291
2,My daughter loves to look through this as I read it to her. She loves alphabet books and this one teaches her about her country.I would highly recommend this book.,163
2,Easy to make. I pack the powder in a shaker cup and add ice cold water when I get the munchies. Tasty and convenient!,117
2,"The money is a great tool to teach kids how to count, give change back.I am very pleased with the product",105
2,As a huge Lightfoot fan I wanted to hear how others covered his songs. I found the selection of some of the songs to be odd as they aren't his best known. The others are the hits you would expect on this album. I found most of the interpertations interesting and worth listening to. In the end it reminded me how great Gordon is both as a song writer and a singer.,364
2,"A short, quick read. Enjoyed it. I am planning a canoe trip,as well, however, he had a motor on his canoe, and I won't, sosome information would not be applicable to my situation. Didfind the personal experiences of interest and the informationon the stops he made and the availability of purchasing supplieshelpful.",316
2,I loved the content of the movie and how the actor was trying to make-up for his loss by bringing happiness to others.,118
2,My granddaughter watches this movie constantly. Cute story line. Funny and cute movie. A must see if you have small kids.,121
2,"This book is an excellent synopsis of the Dragonball series and Dragonball Z up to Captain Ginyus defeat. Even though it is inJapanese, the pictures are of great detail and color and the paper is of high quality. It also gives an entire list of every episode of dragonball z up to that point. They all come with a picture of what happens during the episodes so you can compare to the highly edited english version and see how many fewer episodes it took to reach the same events. It is a must for any Dragonball/Z fan and I highly recommend it.",544
2,"I've been using the Omron for a month now and like is very much. It's reasonably pricedOmron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer, user friendly and the directions for the initial set up are easy to follow. My only disappointment has been in trying to calibrate my stride distance with a known number of miles that I walk each day. Whether I set my stride at 2' or 2'6"", I cannot get the pedometer to register the correct number of miles that I walk. Other than that, I'm happy with it.",482
2,This book was recommended by our Trigger Point instructor. It has been the greatest find ever and has saved me over hundreds of dollars in unnecessary medical care.It thoroughly explains how to get the results you're needing in order to feel relief from pain.I reccomend this book to eveyone! This book has given me the confidence I need in order to heal my own body and to rid myself of illnesses without medication.,417
2,"If you liked the left behind series, you definitely need to read the first three ""before they were left behind"" books.",118
2,these women are so great to listen to when you are having a bad day.laugh it will make you feel better. shipped quick n cheap price,131
2,"But rather I am here to praise the blue swizzle sticks of Accoutrements. For they are blue like no other and they swizzle up a storm. Strong enough for a Blue Hawaiian, yet delicate enough for the aqua-toned Misty Rum Forest, and daring enough to dive, un-color coordinated, headlong into a Mai Tai. One evening, with nothing better to do, I used one to mix and decorate my mojito. Of such experiences one becomes accustomed when you own accoutrements of tiki stirring.",469
2,this was a gift aswell to someone who enjoys games of this sort.theyre truly pleased w. it and i couldnt be happier either !,124
2,"This is a present for my Grandson. The quality is very nice. He had one just like it before and lost it. He really loved it, and asked for another one for Christmas.",165
2,"This isn't my first choice type of book, but it's pretty good. Hard part trying figure out how to write research paper on it",124
2,"A good introduction to a thoroughly arcane subject: The Theory of Relativity. But Aczel dwells far too long on Arthur Eddington and his journey to photograph an eclipse in an effort to prove or disprove Einstein's idea. The book could almost be retitled ""Al and Art Tiptoe Through the Cosmos."" The private respective lives of both Einstein and Eddington are not central to the topic and the search, which Einstein explains as, ""...wanting to know God's thoughts."" The book does present Einstein--justly or unjustly--as someone I wouldn't want to cross.",552
2,"I don't know where Amazon gets its date and shipping estimates from.I ordered this on 12/1/12 and got it on 12/11/12 not after Christmas like Amazontried to tell me. Seems like an attempt to push faster and more expensive shipping rates on people.Cant speak for the quality of the Flags, they are gifts and I didn't open them, buta cursory inspection they look fine from the outside of the packages.",399
2,Purchased this setup for mission trips for our church. Good sound and works well with Passport 500 with quick setup.,116
2,This was the perfect replacement for an old fountain I misplaced. The plastic housing for the base is actually a product improvement.,133
2,Comfortable even though heel is slightly higher than other ECCO shoes. Did not care for the color so had it polished to cordovan.,129
2,"This book helped me understand music theory, thereby improving my music playing and appreciation. The factor that I enjoyed the most about this book is how it can appeal to beginners as well as advanced musicians. He explains everything very clearly. I enjoyed reading this book.",279
2,"This is the third pair of Easy Spirit Romys I have owned( wore the first two pairs out). They are great for everyday use as well for long walks. They are light weight, so very comfortbale and look great. Would rate as probably the best all around sneaker.",255
2,"This was by far one of the best Jim Carrey movies. I laughed so hard throughout the entire thing. Jim Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates, who has a split personality. The other side of Charlie is Hank, the mean one. His personality is hilirious! It is also so funny how Charlie has three black kids that are so smart but curse all the time. You just have to see it. Anyway, if you haven't seen it I recommend it. It is a great comedy that is garaunteed to make you laugh.",469
2,This flash drive works as advertised. I copied over 2.5 GB of pictures from my laptop to this flash drive with no problems. The quality and feel of this product is excellent. I also love that you can slide the usb connector into the protective housing instead of using a cap. This 4GB flash memory is perfect for what I need. I highly recommend it.,348
2,This is a great CD. Buy it! You'll love the melodies and listen to every track over and over (as I did).,104
2,"Great set but no closed caption. No hard of hearing. Oh, they do not understand how big the HOH market is. A hundred million!",125
2,It removed the smell but it tends to come back. I think I need multiple treatments because the car sat for a while.,115
2,"This is an excellent life jacket for dogs, but my Westie should have fit easily in the medium, but it was too big, the small was way too small. The flotation part itself is workable, but I had to make new straps as they would not go small enough on the medium, and the small's flotation part was too small for proper protection and fit!",336
2,"This costume is very nice and fits well (size 8-10). In person, the costume looks exactly how it looks online. I only gave the costume four stars b/c the mask is a bit flimsy and could rip rather easily. Overall, my son loves the costume!",238
2,I used this on both my sons. Jordan loved being wrapped up in . Gabon didn't like being so confined. I liked it and it made them so much fun to cuddle with!,156
2,Wife and daughter like this curler. Highly recommended because good quality for reasonable price. Fit and finish is great and heats pretty fast,143
2,"This gorgeously writtenl mind-bender of a novel is not for people who are afraid to think. Read it and savor the delicate, bracing flavor of brainpops made of cognitive salami. Masticate crunchy kernels of nostalgia and sadness. Treat yourself by decoding this codex of mysterious time-loops and emotional wordplay. Dress yourself in bacon. Challenge yourself. Read it and weep.",378
2,"I do not normally write reviews, but I don't want anyone basing their buying decisions on a reviewer who insists that a band stay within certain musical boundries. True, this disk shows some new directions, but it still exposes its roots. This is one fine recording from start to finish. Whether it pulls from rock, R&B or a little British pop, it still makes me want to hop in the car and head south. ""Yeah, I'll take a Catfish Po-Boy and an Abita Amber""",455
2,"I love this movie...its so classic, and like a Disney but buff and with more romance. Girls kick butt and the fightin scenes are the greatest...one of the best Foreign films Ive seen.",183
2,This is a wonderful early work by Francis Ford Coppola. Just think; Cindy Williams could have been a star.,106
2,"As owners of 4 vehicles, this was a great option for us. It stays in place and can be moved from car to car easily. It has never slipped under any circumstances. Good price too.",177
2,"I ordered the silver one Wed. and recieved it Fri.There is a lot to read, you can't idiot your way through, but it does a lot so I don't mind. Besides, it is really pretty and much more compact than I thought it would be. I am a petite gal who never works out and I was able to lift it. I would have liked more pictures in the instruction manual. I used my rack wrong the first time.",383
2,"I heard this song about a week ago from one of my friends who has it, and its definitely one of the best songs that ive heard in a while. I think its about as good, if not better than Feel It, another song that they have. Which also is worth getting.",250
2,"I love Steve Grand's writing voice. He not only writes clearly and in a conversational style, but he makes the information both accessible and entertaining!",156
2,"A humerous guide for both children and adults. Gives you the history of Crazy Bones, games to play, and listings of the different characters. Needs to be updated to include most recent Bones (like Monster Bones, Dragonball Bones, and Toy Story 2 Bones) but is a good start for most people.",289
2,"This is really the coolest card game ever. I play against kids at school, my dad, and even kids I just meet. The more kids I play with the more freinds I make. The cards themselfes are also really cool 'cause they have amazing artwork and cool desines. Playing the game is so fun, and I think that other kids should drop dumb games like ""Yu gi oh"" and ""pokymen""(I'm suprised that theres kids that even collect those any more!?). This is both a family and a freind game, and I love it!!... {=)",492
2,"this is the neatest gadget since sliced bread!! I love it. It has cut my prep time to almost nothing. I have made salsa and egg salad with it to near perfection. It chops tomatos and cukes like a dream. How did I ever live without one? I just ordered one for my daughter in law, her mother and will gift a friend with one. Please keep these available. They are great. Who ever came up with this should win the ""Nobel Prize"" for making cooking easier.Merle",455
2,"This is a truly moving movie. The little boy playing the main character Chava is extraordinary. There is unfortunately not much background information explaining the reasons for the civil war. Another shortcoming of the movie, according to me, is that it tends to give an idyllic account of the guerilla, who appear as the ""good guys"", while the army are the bad ones. I doubt this was entirely the case, although I am not a specialist in this case.For a probably more realistic account of the ways of guerillas in Latin America, check ""Palomas de papel"".",555
2,I have used this facial steamer about 5x now and I have to say it works well at opening your pores but the negative about it is that it gets very hot and you have to stay so far away from it or it will burn. Otherwise it works like it says it will and I am happy with my purchase.,280
2,This video was completelly worth the money. All the videos in it rocked and he had such great music in them that it was also like getting two things for the price of one. This video is a must have for any Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers fan.,241
2,"Fruit is given to my chinchilla about every other day. Although these are actual SLICES of the fruit, as in big for a chinchilla, I cut them up and they will last 3x longer! The chinchilla took right too it! HE loves it",219

2,I love this show! I wish Tila would make another one. All of the deleted and bonus scenes you get is amazing!,109
2,Bought this toy as a gift for my sister's westie. Her dog often chooses this chew bone over raw hides and pig ears. Great product.,130
2,"This stuff is fabulous! Much better than what I thought I was getting (the Liz Claiborne Realities) when I happened to find the small pink package at TJ Maxx for $12 last summer, just shopping for last-minute things to bring on vacation. Customs confiscated it on the way back from Grand Cayman, so I promised myself I would get the big bottle when I found it again. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price - way better than drugstore prices.",461
2,No more tapping and banging on jar lids to get them open. Amco Swing-A-Way really does what it promises and loosens any size jar lid with ease. A perfect gift for yourself or anyone else you know who has struggled with stubborn lids. This is one of those perfect tools I wish I had discovered years ago.,303
2,"Although lacking the pristine gloss and soaring masterpiece solos of Venus Isle and Ah Via Musicom, there's a youthful energy and excitement of Eric's unending creativity that truly captures his basic instinct for creating fresh angles in rock gutiar music. Zap is smokin'!!",274
2,The title pretty much says it all. With most dance videos selling for upwards of a hundred dollars this Merce Cunningham dvd is a steal.,136
2,"This is a great collection of the GILMORE GIRL tv series. It is so fun to watch. If you love the show, you will love this collection of the entire series!",154
2,"I love it when the series is all done, and I can burn through it without having to wait for the next book to be written. This was a very good book.",147
2,"I have read that several people had problems dealing with this company's customer service, but my experience was great. They were very helpful, friendly, and expediant.The greatest thing about this product is that, unlike the toilet, I don't have to scrub around it every time my son uses it. There is no splashing, forgetting to put up the seat (or lid), or falling in it. You still have to keep it clean, but it saves parents a lot of time and energy.Totally worked for my son...and it has only been 3 weeks!",510
2,"As I expected, this was like all Daniel O'Donnell's DVDs, ""GREAT"". I really wish the whole show could have been on one DVD.",123
2,It is pricey but hell I woulda paid double cause it cleared up my face in 4 days and I cant tell you how much of a pain ingrowns were to my skin.GOOD STUUFF,156
2,"Bought it for my 9 year old who has tough time getting going. The alarm is too much! Way too loud. But the vibrating alternative is great-wakes her without overwhelming her. She likes the colorful numbers and they give off a comforting glow. It is bigger than I expected but she likes the heart shape, color and 'jeweled' contol buttons, which she can use herself very easily.",376
2,Great transaction. This is not as good of a book as I thought but I bought it for a great price! Thanks!,104
2,"I love Southern Living cookbooks. Every recipe I try is a success and becomes a family favorite, ""tried and true"" recipe. The ""Hummingbird Cake"" is my son's absolute favorite and the baked Artichokes w/Sundried Tomatoes is always a hit with company. You won't be disappointed with the recipes in this cookbook!",310
2,I found that this item tends to relieve anxiety and depression on a temporary basis.It has worked for me.It is worth a try.,123
2,This was a great solution for my grand daughter who was 2 and refusing to sit in her high chair any longer. Having her sit on her knees on a table chair was not safe. She gladly sits in her new chair at the table and is much safer.,231
2,"The Circle Trilogy is amazing! I loved all of the action and mystery! Which world is real? Does the fate of one world affect the other? Wow!! The story was awesome. I love how Ted Dekker used this to show that God can do big things with normal, everyday people! I could not put this book down. This is not one to start if you can't go with out sleep for a few nights! I am eagerly looking forward to the release of Green later on this year!",440
2,My husband was absolutely delighted with this purchase as a Christmas gift. He is in a range shooting club and he loves it.,123
2,"I thought the book was filled with insightful looks at the way people perceive others, yet often are misguided by their perceptions. It seems that depending upon individual circumstances human beings can run the gamut of emotions and be attentive or uncaring and uncompromising. The narrative style was very interesting. Mr. Kamau's humor and style of communicating feelings of faith, love, optimism, and enthusiasm leads to an enthralling read. The Tender Warriors Book Club rates Pictures of a Dying Man a must read.",518
2,"Scott's CD is an excellent blend of classical piano and modern rock/pop melodies. I have seen him play in person, and can say that his style of piano is unique and distinctive. I highly recommend this CD",203

2,"this book was wonderful, stellar character development. A must read book for anybody that is interested in the not so traditional love story romance. A modern contemporary must read.",182
2,"This was definitely not what I expected, but as an Elvis-phile, I rushed right in and bought it, without realizing what I was getting. I didn't like it on first pass, but having listened to it several more times, I really do like it. If you like the Elvis Costello genre of music, you will like this.",300

2,"Wow, this is a departure for tommy, as far as his crue stuff goes. Its a nice ""fleshing out"" of his earlier solo stuff (welcome to planet boom). Anyway, it rocks, its quick, and darn if some of that stuff isn't catchy also.",223
2,"This book was hard to put down. The story was excellent, and the erotic scenes were just as good. Like all of Anne's books, this one was very tastefully done. Well worth it!",173
2,"As always, Bradbury takes us into his prolific mind of the past and the future. He let's us see, once again, how it could have been. Sweet, aromatic, and soft. The interrealtionships, and the mysteries of life are all there for you, if you are ready for the visit.",264
2,"I purchased this book for my association's (real estate) media center.

2,"But I couldnt. This was actually a pretty decent flick. I havent seen the vampire one so I cant compare it but the story was a lot better then I had expected and the .07 cents I paid to watch it was well worth it. Seriously, this is a movie to watch when you want to have fun. It reminds me of a lot of horror movies I used to watch in the early 90s from Charles Band and the Troma guys. I enjoyed it from beginning to the end.",427

2,"I thouroughly enjoyed reading an advance copy of Ms. Berg's latest book and am happily anticipating her next one! The research and Montana setting, plus the adventurous hero Duncan Kincaid, remind me of an Indiana Jones adventure, but with more fun, and the added spice of romance. This is a change of pace from her other books, but still a fast and exciting experience!",370

2,"Pampers are by far the best diaper if you have a large baby. However, Amazon claimed that the item would ship within 24 hours but it took over a week for them to actually ship the product which means I didn't get the product until over two weeks after I ordered it. So . . . I'm very pleased with the product and the price but not so much with the service. I ended up having to buy diapers at Walmart to hold us over until my Amazon order came in.",447

2,"Blurring the boundaries of punk rock and folk music, TV Smith delivers a powerful cd, full of intelligent lyrics, rich melodies and working-class angst.

2,"It is blue, it holds air, (once you have the stopper that should have come with it) and seems to work like every other stability ball I've ever seen.It was a bummer that the plug that was supposed to be in the box was missing, but with a call and a few days wait it arrived in the mail and I was all set. The pump that it comes with does fine for inflating it, so no complaints here.To really add value, I recommend getting a dark sharpie pen and making a fun face on the side!",477

2,"Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band / Greatest Hits: This has a lot of Seger's great hits but it is incomplete without ""Greatest Hits 2"".

I couldn't be happier with this product!",448

2,"Terry Stamp and Jim Avery and company provide the perfect antidote to the complexities that became adult oriented rock. This was uncompromising honest stuff. Brilliant songs, well performed.

Just why did Brad have to come back?! I think that Mrs. Campbell is doing good, and if you read it you find out the nest book is... drumroll... ""On the Track!!!"" Finally, TB's are doing what this series was born to do. And Christina isn't that bad, but she is a little stubborn. Great series and book!",481
2,"As the author states, this is not another book of how computers work. I had been looking for a book that explained how a microprocessor does what it does. And with this book I got that and much more. I should also say that this book is good only if you love computers, because otherwise, it would be a little bored, especially because it goes beyond software into hardware and talks a lot about digital electronics and logic gates. But to me, it is very very good and I recommend it to everyone who has a real interest in computers.",532

2,"Charlotte Perkins Gilman is a little known woman, but certainly deserves her place in society and in the history of the women's movement.",137
2,"This book is probably one of the most fascinating ones I've ever read just because of the sheer way it is written. It is not written like most books and it often seems as if the writer is untrained yet they weave a spell. The book is based on realism yet it turns into these fantastical things like fairies, angels, and spirits! It is much easier also to read the 5 books in a row rather than trying to read one and then buy the next one ect.",442
2,"My 2 years old daughter loves her Dora pillow. I put it on the rocking chair for her to find it, as a surprise and she was so happy to find it that she dropped (instantly) a toy she was carrying and ran to ger her Dora pillow. She sleeps with her, it is like having a little buddy !",282

2,I never really got into Rainbow until I heard Ronnie James Dio. I must say that his voice sounds even better on this recording than it does in his Dio days. Plus Ritchie Blackmore is a brilliant guitar player. Live the band is incredible with Dio displaying his huge vocal range and Blackmore soloing into the stratosphere. I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Dio's voice and awesome guitar playing.,413
2,Brian Froud's fantasy art illustrating Joni Mitchell's song makes this book an exquisite magical journey into something we often take for granted - the beginning of a new day. It's a treasure for children and adults alike.,222

2,"This is the one shell programming book that every engineer will want to have on their desktop. It is concise without being cryptic; Blinn's prose style is clear and straightforward. The concepts and syntax of the Bourne shell are explained in great detail, without reading like a man page. The examples are excellent and are explained line-by-line. If you have been frustrated in the past by 800-page behemoths filled with whitespace, pointless diagrams, and small talk, you will be pleasantly surprised. It is simply the finest book available on the subject.",559
2,My doctor recommended this product a few years ago when I began to have sinus problems. These seem to come in the winter.Ponaris helps tremendously with dry sinus and stuff conditions. I like it because it's a natural product and you don't develop a dependency on it.,267
2,"The movie on the back saids that has spanish subtitles, I brough it for my g/f, because she doesn't understand english subs. that much. On the settings menu, theres only english & NO spanish what so ever, thats the ONLY negative detail I have to say.",250
2,My 3 year old daughter LOVES Olivia and this book too. Whenever we misplace something we always check the places that Olivia does in the book. Her favorite part of the book is the page that shows Perry's shadow against the wall. I thought this page might be a little scary as the dog's shadow is large and tooth-filled - but it wasn't. We go through and identify each body part and its shadow on the wall. Going through this has shown my daughter that shadows aren't scary but usually of things that we love. Great book!,520
2,"Overall good anthology of rap hits by the group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, but missing the awesome track 'No Surrender' (can find on their first EP), one of the best rap songs EVER. Why isn't it here?! Anyway, good CD to pick up to new listeners to Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, and worth it.",279

2,This book is a wonderful book that will make you cry with every passage you read. This book reminds me time an again when I read it that my mother truely cares and has thoughts she finds hard to speak and this book allows me to take notice of her thoughts and feelings...And that other mothers feel the same,307

2,"I got this book at the local college bookstore for a class I am taking of beginning Chinese (hanyu). I use it on tests along with my dictionary and I am still surprised that it hasn't been taken away because it is so helpful it's almost like cheating. Almost anytime I can't find a character in my textbook or dictionary, I count the strokes and look up its pinyin in my book. I don't know where I'd be without it. Or how I might survive in Taiwan without it.",459

2,"My boyfriend recommended this mount for my Garmin GPS. I previously had the mount that goes on the window, and it interferred with the view out the windshield. This particular mount is wonderul. The GPS stays put on the dash wherever I put it, even when I had to stop VERY suddenly when a fool who was trying to pass 3 cars coming towards me on Rt 17 almost hit me head on. Everything else in the front went sliding forward, but the garmin stayed put. A very good product.",472
2,"Green's translation seems to capture the frustrating, obvious, mocking, simple character of the lessons of the great Chinese Zen masters. Some of the prose is beautiful. Some is poetic. Some of it is deep like a pond with brilliant light reflected on its surface. The bigger the challenge, the bigger the reward.",312
2,"We just gave this to my 5 yr old yesterday for christmas. He has not put it down since. He hasn't played with anything else. I've already ordered more games and the carrying case.

2,"This CD is great. Anyone who is a fan of Hootie and the Blowfish will appreciate this disk. Lyrically speaking, this CD is definitely the strongest CD to come from Hootie and the Blowfish. My personal favorite is entitled ""I Hope that I Don't Fall in Love with you."" This track was recorded when the band began promoting their second album on MTV. I am glad they chose to release it on a CD. This CD is definitely worth owning.",427
2,Go and buy this CD. It is a really good song. It is something you can romance of of with your boo. If you buy this CD you will not be disappointed. I garentee it.,162
2,"I'm no Einstein, but I do know a good book when I read one, and this one qualifies. Bodanis uses the famous equation to share biographical sketches of fascinating scientists working toward the discovery and application of the 20th century's great scientific breakthrough. With any popular science writing success can be measured by how well the author can take the obscure and esoteric come alive and show science to be what it ultimately is, a compelling human story. Without question the author succeeds.",506

2,Fun read for the ladies looking to relive the dating scene. Some parts make me happy I'm happily married while others make me super happy! The story is meant to be fun and laugh out loud funny though so overall it's a good book.,228
2,"What a SHOCK to open both of Sibley's Eastern and Western Field Guides and find Alberta transposed with British Columbia on the endpaper map at the back of each book. I opened a book at the back to read the bio and look at Sibley's photo and glanced at the map and I stared and stared, not believing my eyes. I checked all the provinces and states to make sure that was the only error. Other than that, these books are great, with super illustrations and I appreciate the range maps on the pages with the birds.",511

I met him last year and was surprised of his quality after 55 years working.He gave a splendid concert with the Metropole Orchestra.Also Mel Lewis was in great shape with these recordings. The whole band is a beauty!,312
2,"Ok, I live in Minnesota where it has been -10 for about the last 3 weeks. I spend lots of time out on the ice, ice fishing and these have kept my feet nice and toasty warm. They are a bit on the heavier side, but it's nothing I can't deal with. They stick to the ice great, like I'm walking on cement, and they are the warmest boot I have ever worn. Can't wait to use these for some hunting next fall! Would definitely buy again and I highly recommend them.",457
2,"The gameplay is realistic, the graphics are incredible, and the cars really seem like their going 225 mph. The game does support steering wheels, so I would disregard the other reviews. One problem is that there is no rear view mirror in the in-car view. Create-a-car isn't the greatest either, but other than those few problems the game is great.",347
2,"All the positive things other posters have written are absolutely true. Quiet, efficient, well made, etc., etc. I would definately buy one again.",145
2,"Good read. I enjoyed the techniques, the color, and lots of pictures. Very good for anyone wanting to get into this sewing technique. It makes you want to pull out the machine and get started. Would recommend.",209

2,"Sitting in the movie theatre many years ago, glued to every note that Dylan sung. What an spellbinding performance! Seemingly so simple, yet so timeless.

2,"I have to say, that this album kicks all kinds of butt. There is one song I would have liked to seen included though. At the end of the Ryan episode where he dies, they play an acoustic version of the Dishwalla song Angels or Devils. The combination of that song and the scene brought tears to my eyes. It was one of the most powerful moments for me in the show.",362
2,"i think this toy is fun and different then most toys! It's not like you'd expect somone to come out with a board game where your in a situation of making it "" your board game!"" You can make your own place from most expensive to cheapest* It 's the coolest game and i really recccomend it!",288
2,"Baby tees are hard to find, but I like to pair them with cloth diapers. These tee-shirts are very soft and look cute. I love the colors. The lap collar design makes them easy to get on and off. However, they are sized small. My 5-month-old is wearing the 6-12 month size.",271

2,The cover is one of the hottest covers I've seen in quite awhile (especially if you see it fully open). The story was pretty good but the love scenes left a little to be desired. Dillon Blackhawk should have been a biker with his attitude and looks.,249

2,"This is not the original I was trained to use but it works as well or better than Goodall's. I use it twice a year and have found the student responses are more in depth for interpretation than their psychoeducational or psychological reports. You can find more quickly where the ""hope"" level is and put energy into those who are reachable and refer those who aren't. I have collected hundreds of these samples over the years and find most are right on the mark. Of course, it mustn't be used as a diagnostic tool but it works well as a verifier of info.",554

2,"I never could rationalize using a traditional electric coffee maker for a 1_1/2cup of coffee, and usually when I did the end result would be bland and unsatisfactory. I'm glad I have this, its made a small cup of coffee so easy. The small amount was always hard to come by when using ground coffee in an electric brewer so I have had to stick with instant, which usually has no variety in flavors. This thing made my process of making iced or hot coffee with grounds so simple with quick clean up.",497

2,I was looking for a nylon fork that wouldn't scratch my non-stick frying pan. The local stores didn't have anything that even comes close to this fork. It's very sturdy and the tips are nicely pointed for turning bacon or anything else you need a fork for when cooking. I'm very happy with this product.,303
2,"Come on now..seriously. It's just a paddle ball toy. The ball is already on a string and it comes ready to play with out of the package. The string is already attached to the paddle in the package. Even if it does somehow come unattached, there is a hole in the paddle to stick it back through and tie it off.I honestly think the negative review was meant as a bad joke. Notice they rated the toy with 5 stars for durability. Strange if it cause so much trauma to the family.",475

2,This is an absolutely amazing book! It is a touching story about a man's love for his wife and the trails they are put through in their elderly years. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. It's simply wonderful.,224
2,this lifts very well with 30 v. no bleaching is required and it comes out very bright on lighter hair. also it does no leave hair dry and damaged like normal bleach and add dye routines,185
2,"This is wonderfully silly parody of the Bulldog Drummond British pulp series. If you like Monty Python style humor, you'll love this. The original play is a tour d'force for the actors who play multiple characters and continues to be produced in college and community theatres every year.",288
2,"A wonderful film with a star performance by actor Christian Slater(Heathers, True Romance, Soldiers Of Fortune, etc) as well as his co-stars. A real thrill ride! Would recommend for anyone seeking a film with plenty of on the edge of your seat moments.",252
2,"This book is by far the best book I have ever read, and that is saying a lot.I have read it more than 10 times over, and I know that I will keep on reading it over and over again till the pages disintegrate. I made sure to have more than one copy, just incase they go out of print.",281
2,"After about an hour of installation time, my Toto S300 was ready for a test drive. The directions were easy to follow and any handy-person equipped with a wrench and screwdriver could manage the job. All plugged-in, Toto operated perfectly, with all the features listed and more (auto timer and energy saver for the heated seat was unexpected). The remote works beautifully, and is really self-explanatory.Spending a penny has never been so much fun....and paper free!",468
2,"Canon EF 100-400mm f4.5-5.6L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR CamerasI am a photo enthusiast and I have really been enjoying this new lens. I've been taking a lot of photos of birds in and around where I live and so for it has lived up to all my expectations.And I don't mind the manual focus at all, I'm used to the manual lenses, as that is what I had on my old Canon AE1 camera. I get good sharp pictures, even when I use the 1.4 extender and tripod of course.I would recommend this lens to friends, and anyone who would ask about it.",545
2,"Cal and Jane from Nobody's Baby But Mine reappear in this story of Cal's brother Gabe. His other brother Ethan is the secondary plot. This books makes me the most sniffly of all SEP books. It's definitely darker and more emotional than most of her works but still very much a terrific read.Gabe lost his family and never really recovered. It takes meeting Rachel, who has lost everything, to bring him back to life. Together they help each other heal and build a new life together.",481
2,"While one of my goldens has no time for this toy (she is a princess who doesn't like to work for her food), my male LOVES his tug-a-jug! He will work at it for an hour until all the kibble is dispensed. You can actually see the wheels turning as he figures it out, and he is pooped when he's done. Great for body and brain. Only caveat: use this toy on carpet-- it is really noisy on a bare floor!",397
2,"Travel along with Rory Nugent, and you will experience an adventure not soon to be forgotten.I very much enjoyed the premise of his trip, as outlandish as it may seem.",167
2,This bible is very attractive and recieves compliments regularly. A unique feture that I enjoyed was the several pages of lined paper bound into the back of the bible. The lined pages as well as the numerous other pages set aside for marking allow the owner to note endless texts and ideas. The wide margin gives ample space for notes next to texts. The bible is quite large as compared to other bibles and would make a excellet study bible for pastors or those interested in a personal study bible. A beautiful bible I am VERY happy with. Highly Recomended.,558
2,"Perhaps the best thing about the three essays published in this exhibition catalogue is their readability. You don't need to be a student of the History of art to appreciate and understand them. However, they are by no means dumbed-down either. The images chosen for the exhibition are truely lovely. There are genre scenes, sea scapes, still lives (both floral and breakfast images), church interiors, and potraits. It is a wonderful little gem.",446
2,Reasonable price for 3 book set on Vatican II.Easy to understand and use.,73
2,"No real big complaints here, except it was later than I had expected. Besides that, good seller, no problems with the product.",126
2,"This is a small, easily read book of quotes. There were several inspiring quotes and several famous quotes. Sometimes it seemed as though there were repeats of quotes or they were stuck on a theme. I wish the book was longer and referenced more outstanding speakers/thinkers. OVERALL... I am very satisified. I purchased this book as a resource for students it will fit well in the classroom.",392
2,"this is a fun light-hearted movie. I tend to care for easy going, not too complicated movies. The sense of humor is classic, not modern. This movie is clean, in humor and in inuendos. If you lean toward the classics, i do believe this one would please.",252
2,"I love it that this is stainless and enamel. It works well although sometimes you need to quarter your lemons rather than halve them if they are large. Otherwise they don't fit in the squeezer. Pops in the dishwasher, easy to clean. Seems very sturdy.",251
2,"I really really enjoyed this CD. It was very good. My favorite song is Dammit, and I also like Enthused.",104
2,Not my favorite of the Janine French books but a very good book to own as part of the collection.,97
2,it is a very good book but the english that it is written in is different from the way we speak today. I enjoy the book and will recommend it to everyone looking for something that is good to read and to all children for their classes that require reading books.,262
2,"I installed a couple of these bulbs in my basement, but mostly installed GE 15W flourescent bulbs. These are in a zone to provide quick light. The flourescents take about 1 minute to fully brighten. However, I like the light from the flourescents better and they use about 20% of the electricity. These have a slightly yellowish light compared to the flourescents.",364
2,"I bought this to hang in my office, both because it looks amazing and to mess with the Cubs fans I work with. It's made of really nice-looking wool and the stitching seems to be high quality. My only complaint would be that it came folded up, so it's got two pretty prominent creases in it.",290
2,"Well. I broke down and got a PSP. I had to decide on a game, and i wanted it to be one i wouldn't get sick of in a week and i think i found it!Lumines is addicting and so much fun to play. I like how the music and graphics get cooler the better you do..very fun!a fun and 'safe' first game for you PSP..",303

2,"The movies on this DVD is as good as one can expect (I like western movies; therefore, I cannot give a bad review unless it is really bad). The actors in these movies were in my opinion is amongst the best of the eraReccomends to others who wish to purchase",257
2,This is one great looking watch. Clearly much attention was made to the design & making of this timepiece. I usually don't like large watches but this one is well balanced for size & weight. You owe it to yourself to own at least one quality watch & this one should be it.,272
2,A quick search will show you a price for $363.00 on the internet. Amazon isn't THAT convenient to almost pay double....,119
2,A tremendous artist gone too soon. This dvd has all the hits and sounds great. Wish I could get my hands on the DF Soundstage.,126
2,"This album reminds me of The Cocteau Twins, The Cardigans and The Smiths. The female singer has a voice that reminds me of Siouxie & The Banshees. The songs are good and the music is really thought provoking.",208
2,"Initally, I didn't think much about this movie, and had completely forgotten about it until I was lucky enough to catch it by accident on cable while housecleaning. Needless to say, the chores were put on delay that day. I have since seen this several times and it still has me cracking up. Now here's the real selling point: For me to actually order myself a copy instead of waiting for reruns says it all.Much funnier than I thought.",435
2,"yes , like many i would just die to have them on dvd. i have most of them i taped on VHS, but it isn't the same !! I know others feel the same way. with the complex storyline, and great cliffhangers, you juste need to be able to watch them in order from front to back!!!!!!!!!!! With, great acting, plot and filming this deserves to be on DVD. ""We wnat alias on DVD.We wnat alias on DVD.We wnat alias on DVD.We wnat alias on DVD.We wnat alias on DVD. etc, etc...",462
2,"An excellent book for the general reader not familiar with the subject. Learning to recognize situations and ""name"" them is a very powerful tool.",145
2,I've been in love with this cuticle cream since I used it for the first time. I just put a little around my nails about once a day and my cuticles are very soft and nice. No dry and breaking cuticles. I was really amazed when a friend asked me how I have such nice cuticles - so it must show. It is so much better than any other cuticle product I've ever used.,360
2,"""Mean Girls"" is one of the most original, well acted, and simply excellent movies of the year. It deserves a place on any critics Top 10 list and is well worth watching. Grade: A++",180
2,"Richard Armstrong spins a fast-paced, delightful yarn of the ultimate gambling ""system"" interestingly based on a real theory proposed by Juan Parrondo of The University Of Madrid. Mixed together with casinos, con games, the Mafia, and an assortment of bizzare characters this novelis one that any gambler (or one considering gambling) simply cannot miss.",354
2,"Most of pieces of Boies border on idolatry. Donovan's work is special because although she clearly admires Boies and his work, she also points out his faults. The best reading in the book includes her digging behind the scenes to reveal what really happens in trials, settlements, and negotiations. While Boies is obviously one of the top trial lawyers in America, he often gets credit for things which are actually the result of other events. Donovan captures this wonderfully.",478
2,"i saw the whole entire season it was awesome, but i don't think that it's worth to spend $40 on the whole season with 7 disks, it might have special features but i wouldn't agree to buy it. The only reason i put 5 stars is because the show is phenomenal! It won best drama series 5 times! Each for each year it filmed! I totally agree that they should win! If you never saw it i reccomend you just to BORROW it from Blockbuster. :)",431
2,"This is a very interesting documentary on Natasha Makarova's return to Leningrad after having defected years earlier. While most of it will only interest die hard Makarova fans, the extended clip of ""Eugene Oneign"" at the Kirov will thrill all.",244
2,This is a nice heavy quality stapler - Swingline always is! I wanted something good for my husband's desk and this staple works beautifully for him.,148
2,"My granddaughter, now 19 months, has been watching this series since she was one year old. It holds her interest, yet seems to calm her, unlike so much children's programming that tries to hold the child's interest by means of excitement. Oswald is a good choice close to bedtime.",280
2,"When I was a small child (three or four?) a family friend gave me a set of small books containing A boy, a Dog, a Frog, and a Friend. I was mesmerized by Mercer Mayer's classic pictures. While I liked having an adult share it with me, this was a book I most enjoyed looking at on my own. I cherished the set but over the years I lost all but one of the tiny books. I was delighted to find this small copy. A wonderful book for young imaginative children.",454
2,"The Dwarf Trumpkin tells the children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy)the story of Prince Caspian and how he escaped the castle of Miraz for fear of his life. With the help of Aslan,(the lion)and the children, Caspian defeats Miraz and became the new king of Narnia.",266
2,I love the workouts. Butsome of the movements are so fast it's difficult to keep up.One of the DvD's didn't work at all. Sent it back 2 or more weeks ago and still have not received a replacement. So I'm not very happy with SMV.,228
2,"I grew up in Terry's church in Brighton, England and experienced much of this story over the years. Having said that, this book filled in many gaps for me. It is a delight to personally know many of the names mentioned and to have a record to remember where it all began. If you are interested in the values of Newfrontiers please read this book - it will make the wonderful family of Newfrontiers churches more personal to you.",428
2,"Had an ick outbreak in my freshwater planted tank. Fish where looking pretty bad. Added Quick Cure and white spots decreased overnight (I used tetra dosage, 1 drop/2 gallons). No signs of ick after 2 days (4 doses) of treating. Added treatment 2 more times after fish cleared up. Two weeks later and no sign of ick.",315
2,I use this for my Canon 1000D and could not be happier. It has plenty of storage capacity for a long weekend of heavy shooting. Purchase two of these for the price. Have had no problems in 6+ months of heavy use. Would purchase again.,234
2,"Ludlum has put together a very good plot. Problem is, the dialogue is just ridiculous for the first hundred or so pages. Don't give up on it. The story unfolds at a good clip, with only a couple parts that make you wonder about the characters' intelligence. As with all of Ludlum's heroes, Drew Latham is practically superhuman in ability, but that is acceptable because the story is really outstanding. If you really like Ludlum, it is worth reading this book. There is some vintage Ludlum action and twists, not quite enough, but it is there. Read it.",553
2,The book looks like new; no scraches or anything! It is in excellent condition! I am very pleasant with it! Thanks! ;),118
2,"Although a little pricy, the product is exactly what I was searching for. Although, designers of waffle makers will never learn - develop a product that the grates can be removed for ease of cleaning!! Amazon provided fast and reliable service throughout this transaction.",272
2,"This CD was a complete suprise to me and my friends. I saw BeBe perform with Anastacia on the Women in Rock on TV and I thought he was fantastic. What a lovely voice. This Christmas CD is a timeless chestnut. (pun intended). I LOVE the duet with Rob Thomas. This is MY Christmas Prayer, indeed!",294
2,"This is great at making toast - what a concept! The toaster is a bit larger than most two slice toasters, but it is a clean and handsome design. The controls are straightforward, effective, and intuitive, with a solid feel to them. The results are very consistent. The bagel setting lets you tap a button right after pressing down the bread lever and it reduces the power to the outer toasting elements and lights up an indicator lamp. The inside of the bagel, English muffin, or whatever is then toasted to perfection without scorching the outer crust.",553
2,"Since I have recieved this T.V there was not another t.v that i have watched. Amazing Quality, HD is perfect....Only Paid 1,500....Are you serious?? For a 61in Dlp Hdtv??? CHEAP....I get Compliments for this t.v everyday....people are shocked when i tell them i only paid 1,500 for it....havnt tested all the feauters on it but i know already they are good. One drawback is the Ugly Remote.....its long and it just doesn't look good....If you are looking for a big tv with a cheap price w/ a great quality....THIS IS YOUR T.V!",526

2,"Once my family started eating a lot of potatoes and sweet potatoes I found it necessary to purchase a good scrub brush as we like to leave the skin on.This is great, really cleans the potatoes and other root vegetables really well. Easy to clean and easy to use even for someone with XL hands like myself.OXO has yet to disappoint me.",334
2,this is a great slicer. its cut everything i throw at it... makes great chips... but do be careful it does like to cut your fingers... thats the only reason i didn't give 5 stars... ive cut myself just about everytime i use it...it is kinda cumbersome but its easy enough to use.. i enjoy it and use it in my concession stand everyday,334
2,"Excellent adaptation of the classic book, that gives a voice to creatures in a new and startling way. It helps to love horses, but this viewpoint will speak to animal lovers, and help impress on young children the importance of pet responsibility. After all, as the main character clearly says, all animals have no choice, and no voice.Better that we should care for them even more diligently. The film clearly brings out how an animal suffers, if their care is neglected, even once. Very instructive, and highly recommended for all ages.",538
2,"This is a great album. Every Al fan has to buy this album.My favorites are Headline News, You Don't Love Me Anymore,Money For Nothing/ Bevery Hillbillies and Polka Your Eyes Out.Add this to you collection now.",209
2,"This is a solid great looking watch. If you don't know better and know a little about watches, the deal of the decade. I have had two Rolodex owners ask me if this is the new model.Don't rely on this watch to be 30+/- sec. per day, mine runs fast. With that said, it is still a great watch that I enjoy as a daily ware.",319
2,"Hand and RingI had a hard time putting this book down! I have read a good many of Anna Katharine Green books and am really enjoying her books, this being one of the best so far.There are multiple possible guilty persons to a murder that happens in a small town in NY. The story twists and turns and kept me guessing throughout as to the outcome.",345
2,very cute and very inexpensive! got this for my friend for her birthday- she loved them. they look and feel a bit more on the plastic side rather than crystal but still cute all the same.,187
2,"This book is an excellent exploration into the history and meaning of menstruation.""In many times and in many cultures, menstruation has been seen as sacred and special, but today, reverence has been replaced by silence, ignorance, and PMS jokes."" (Quoted from the back cover.)I highly recommend this book, it looks at the subject of menstruation in a profound new way, that most people would never think of. There is also a large bibliography for anyone who would like read even more about menstruation.",504
2,"French charm and humour well sustain this work of bringing up the sons family and boy's explorations from his very childhood to manhood, sexually and geographically.It is a nice work.",183
2,"While Carol's experience is somewhat unique, her story and the application of the principles of faith to our own difficulties and disappointments in life, as well as others around us, is uplifting, encouraging and filled with hope. This book helps us to look outside of the dark and isolating closet we find ourselves in when an Issac experience enters our lives, or those around us, and see that we can carry on.",413
2,"This book provides a decent overview of the different aspects of computer/information security, and is an easy read, but if you are a software developer or IT professional, you may want to consider purchasing a few more specialized books instead.",246
2,"I bought this perfume for my daughter because I thought the bottle was pretty. She has a red, black and white bedroom and the bottle looks gorgeous on her dresser. The scent is nice. It's a soft, old-fashioned scent and reminds me of something that women in the 1800's might have actually worn.",294
2,I enjoyed this book just for the pictures and explainations of paper piecing. It gave excellent examples and I look forward to using these patterns in the near future.,167
2,It took 2 days with standard shipping and was in excellent condition.,69
2,"I bought the large dice for my 90-year-old mother. She loves to play games (Yahtzee, Farkle) but has a hard time seeing the smaller dice. The dice are larger and she can see them better, but I did not realize how large they would be. It is a little difficult to pick up 6 large dice to throw them. You need two hands. We use a cup to put them in and then throw. Otherwise, it is a great idea!",392
2,"We purchased archery equipment for our teens for Christmas. Got the best prices on Amazon and our teens love them, gets them out of the house! We use three bails of hay for target.",180
2,"""If you only buy one cd this year..."" ...You need to buy more music! But seriously, no matter what you buy Buddy is a must for everyone's music collection. The new recording of Wait For You is awesome, and with Spring here, this is the cd to take outside and celebrate with, while getting 'Giddy In The Sun'.",308

2,I own this TV and it has all the features of a Sony latest models with the exception of WOW sound and PIP. With the price difference of this TV with the latest model you can buy a good music system. The quality of the picture is good. I hope this helps.,253
2,These capsules are great. I really like them. They are easy to separate and very smooth. Great product!,103
2,"I have been searching for a guide to the arts and craft interior know-how book, not just a lot of idea books which there are a plethora of on the book shelves. This book lays out the sizes of wood to use and the arrangements. I feel now that I can tackle the living room with confidence, something I didn't get with all those picture books of the classical Arts and Crafts interiors.",383
2,The movie moves quickly and keeps your interest. Its good for young and old. It is very Christian (the J word is actually used in its fullness). Blessings to all!,162
2,I could not put this book down. Karen White weaves beautiful southern stories. I envision the characters and the scenes on every page.,134
2,"Let me preface my review by stating that I recently had shoulder surgery and ColPac has been a great source of pain relief!! I own several different sizes of the ColPacs. I have found this size to be perfect for all my needs. Because of the heaviness of the pack, you get a thorough icing of the area. The vinyl is soft yet extremely durable. I highly recommend any of the ColPac products.",389
2,"These toggle clamps and the other variations are just the ticket for jigs and custom clamping device's. Highly adjustable for almost any application, they have too many uses to list in a couple thousand words. I use them on sleds, fences, jigs for cutting miters on small pieces, hold downs for the chop saw and on the drill press, and on the bench to hold small pieces while I carve or sand profiles on them. Once you get a couple and use em, the idea's will flow.Highly recommend.",482
2,My son loves this game! He was 6 yrs old when he started playing and is still having fun with it at almost 8 yrs. It challenges him and he really likes the option to make his own mazes and contraptions. High creativity level.,225
2,originally purchased as a doomat but was too thick for inside my front door so I use it outside my cat's little box to catch the litter from his paws. very fun and ironic.,171
2,"We love LOVE this baby wash. I have used it since my son was first born, and he will soon turn 3. It is expensive, but each bottle does last quite a long time, and its well worth it. The smell is wonderful, and doesn't last long--a good thing in my book, as I don't want him covered in scent, even a naural one. The foam is silky and rinses easily with no residue. When we use a different brand for travelling, I can always tell that his hair isn't as soft and clean as it is with his Earth Mama wash. I only wish I could afford to use it on myself too!",553
2,I absolutely love this quilt. It is light weight and the backing is cotton which is also great. It lays nice on the bed and the colors are beautiful.,149
2,"This is probably manson's 3rd best album. Worth it for the most part, although some of the songs just make you want to jam something sharp into your ears repeatedly (mister superstar, Man that you fear) The other tracks (especially beautiful people, irresponsible hate anthem, the reflecting god, and wormboy) more than make up for this. While it is my opinion that GAOG and Holy Wood are better, this is tied with mechanical animals for 3rd. At least it isn't smells like children. So, in summary, great, but not the greatest.",527
2,"John Thaw is superb in the lead character. This first installment depicts the new relationship between Morse and Sgt. Lewis, and how they come together. In this early episode, Morse is as unorthodox in his approach to solving homicides as he is throughout the series. Sgt. Lewis just begins to get as idea of what his job will be like working (and drinking) with the Chief Inspector.",383
2,This piece of jewerly is pretty in person alot better than the picture. This company will see more business from me. The package was how they said it would come in the mail.,173
2,An excellent summary of key issues that should be avoided to become an effective leader. Would read this over the author's other book (The Ten Commandments ...).,161
2,"I like this book because of what it's about. This book reminded me of Lady and the Tramp because Lady and Shiloh ran away and found somebody they liked to be with. This story is about a dboy named Marty, his dog named Shiloh and Judd Travers. In his story Marty finds Shiloh and wants to keep him , on the other hand Judd was abusing Shiloh. I think this book is for adults and children of all ages.",399
2,"I've built up a pretty good collection of tools over the years and have tried to stay within the best manufactures that each category has to offer. Well, when I saw the disparity here, and the great reviews on this product, combined with the fact that I may only use this a couple times a year I thought I'd give it a shot. Granted the plastics are nowhere near a Makita, etc. but for $25 I'd gladly purchase this again. It won't take the abuse I take on other tools so I don't expect it to be dropped too much.",511
2,r u people just plain stupid? this is a tribute to linkin park by other artist to they're success.,98
2,This basket is big enough to fit one grocery bag or one Westie dog when her short legs get too tired. This basket makes my bike more functional. I'd recommend it to anyone.,172
2,"an amazing work of theology... It not only explains our Judeo Christian Faith, but more importantly is a wonderful guide to a deeper relationship with our Trinitarian God... I believe this book will be an asset to any Christian believer... Pope Benedict XVI has a clear and precise writting style, his books can be easily read by anyone despite the diversity of background knowledge... He is not only a wonderful pastor and theologian but fantastic teacher and a very spiritual guide .",485

2,"This book should be called ""The COMPLETE resource guide for incontinence"" it really contains everything you could possibly wish to know. Best of all it is illustrated and written so that all members of the family of any age can benefit. I never knew there were so many non-surgical products. Well done Dr Wilkes for this extensive book, and thank you, no other book at any price comes close. I would recommend to any people interested in incontinence, if you only ever buy one book, this is it.",494
2,"I thoroughly enjoyed Paul Van Dyk's compilation here especially ""I'm Comin'(to take you away)...very sensual and borderline provacative, ""For An Angel""...great ""T- dance"" tune to get you pumped up on the dance floor...he'll keep you up and bumpin it with the title track ""45 RPM"" with the same high ENRGY tempo. ""Emergency"" will leave you startled as you anticipate the arrival of an ambulance siren. This culminates with a reprised version of ""For An Angel"" leaving you craving more. Keep it comin' PAUL!",505
2,I bought this for my otherhalf as a Christmas Present. He was stoked when he opened it and 5 minutes later I have Slipknot screaming out of my stereo on Christmas Morning. Not exactly a family tradition.lol He loves it and I have now banshed the CD and the excessive noise to his car and new car stereo. At least the peace has returned to my house. :) Enjoy!,358
2,"Very complex, creative and compelling. Gets you into the mindset of the time and place. Makes you want to say, ""why didn't I think of that"" when he brings it up a notch. De Bernieres understands what he is writing about. Love all his works.",240
2,"A voice so pure, effortless and flawless. What a gift - this voice.Brightman turns every song into a seductive love song. She could gargle mouthwash and seduce me. Definitely a CD for cosmopolitan lovers.",204
2,"Chalee is a wonderful female vocalist and songwriter! She's a real woman who's not afraid to bare her soul! There's no fluff here!

If you want great entertainment, this is the CD to buy!",370
2,"A very funny, typically British sitcom. I purchased the collection without preview based solely on the plot. It was quite charming and might deserve 5 stars except that I felt it could have explored a greater diversity of comic situations. If you like British humor it is worth the price.",288
2,"I really have enjoyed this book. This book is not for those who are looking for a historical perspective. The designs are Celtic in spirit and have a great variety of designs. This book is easy to follow with the charts being in color, which is always preferable to symbols. This book has a range in difficulty of projects that are sure to please most.",352
2,It's amazing how JK can keep rolling out such good ones. I'm well into adulthood and still fall in love with every Potter book. Book six sits proudly on my shelf and hasn't been snatched off by my covetous roommate just yet.,224

2,"I first heard it on France's version of VH-1. I was so mesmerized by ""Assassine."" My brother went to a music store across from our hotel in Paris and bought one for me and one for him. I haven't stopped listening to it! And I got it two years ago! It's way good!",262
2,"The position of More's ""Utopia"" is rather like that of the baby in the Jugement of Solomon One school of thought claims it as a Catholic tract in which anything resembling communist propaganda should be interpreted as moral allegory. Another claims it as a politial manifesto, in which all references to religion should be firmly ignored. Both claimants seem more concerned with the rights of ownership than with the work itself, and are quite prepared to chop it in half, or at least to pluck out and cast from they any part of its anatomy that offends them.",559
2,"I own 3 pairs, comfortable and durable yet a bit heavy and clunky. I like these for longer distance months. Great for the price.",128
2,"This will be one of the most amazing books you have ever read. For the rest of your life, you will be telling all your friends and associates what you have learned from it.",172
2,This robot is for adult collectors only. It will not last long if played with or handled roughly. It does look awesome on my shelf though. I really like it.,156
2,"Book is entertaining and reveals that money doesn't make everyone happy. It is primarily a social criticism of the rich, private school he attended. Bret Easton Ellis enraged many of the people he went to school with because he drew from his own experiences to create this scathing criticism of what a private school in the Northeast of the United States was like. It kept me entertained as I saw many of the same things occuring during college in the 90's!",457
2,"Cray has written a great book that made you not only feel like Mia but made you think like her and try to scream clues to her. This book is the best thiller I have ever read and it deserves many awards and praise. I hope all his future books are this great, I can't wait to read them!",284
2,"I was a member of the 1st battlion/9th Marines at Khe Sahn during the seige. I found the book accurately describes it as I remember it(deja vu). It describes life in your little world(~20 ft of trench & bunkers)that we lived, fought in & died in the 77 day long seige. It was the worst place in the world & the most honored place due to all the blood we shed. Khe Sahn is a major part of my life, no matter how old I become.",424
2,"I bought this toy for my 1 Year old daughter as a christmas present, but her six and four year old sisters love this toy too.They all play together on this toy.The kids just love it. Great toy",192

2,"I just love Valerie Bertinelli. This movie is a must see. A fun romantic family movie, you will enjoy it.",105
2,"I think this book is very smart. It made me think about dating in a whole new way, and at age 58 being back in the dating market for 8 years, that's really saying something! The ideas are really creative - I can't wait to try them out, espcially Step #9.",254
2,I love these so much more than the little clippers for baby nails. I use them on my infant and my 5 year old. They work wonderfully.,132
2,"I ordered this based on the reviews and the price. For the amount I paid for it, this is a powerful little coffee grinder. It is easy to use and does the job.The only reasons for the one-star deduction are: 1. It gives off a slight odor when you hold the grinding button down for more than a couple of seconds. I don't notice this if I just pulse on and off. 2. The capacity - if you make coffee for multiple people in the morning, you would probably have to grind beans in batches. I need to grind about 6-8 spoonfuls of beans per day, which it handles just fine.",564
2,"Christopher Bolan's Banyon Tree also provides excellent drama, set in rural Ireland in modern times and pairing Fiona Shaw's reading with the story of a woman who marries a man with a dangerous secret, bears his children, and struggles with neighbors. Ireland comes alive, here.",278

Peter has a little sister named Jenny and a mom and dad. Whenever Peter does something to his grandpa he gets back. And one time grandpa took Peter fishing. If you want to know more read it.,372
2,"Bought this for my cat that I got from the animal shelter. She has been sneezing & wheezing alot. I tried fish amoxi but that didn't help much. I found this by chance while looking at different things I could use for her. I put 1/4 teaspoon into her wet food and she eats it. She is very finicky but she eats this,just try to put alittle by her nose to get her used to it. She is doing much better & I saved a lot on vet bills also. I will be buying this again.",461
2,"I hardly ever write reviews but had to in this instance. This was an fabulous workout, from the music to the length, just the overall workout itself. I highly recommend this low impact, high intensity dvd.",205
2,"If you ride your bike at night you really need this product! One of my older bikes is reserved for riding the trails at night. I've use these High-Viz strips not only on my bike frame, but also on my helmet. It is hard to believe how good these strips work. Fortunately, my bike frame is gray so these strips blend right in during the daylight hours, but they really pop out at night.",384
2,"My concern about most of the fairy tales (Snow White, Cinderella, etc) is that it is the girl who is always seeking to be pretty to please the prince. What a twist Bubba is! For once, its the guys who are seeking the affection. Great for young girls in whom you want to establish a strong sense of self worth. Ketteman - send us another!",337
2,one of the best trance hits. i love every remix of this song but my favourite has to be the gabriel & dresden chillout mix...by far. amazing song.,146
2,"I had to buy this CD so that I could listen to it at home on the turntable, as well as in my car and in my office..that goes for any or all America music!

2,"If you zoom in on the picture, you'll notice that it's actually 16 gauge wire. I received it and can confirm that it's 16 gauge. Wire works fine, although the spool that's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing. It's not a big deal though, and my only disappointment was on my end when I realized 100' wasn't enough to hook up my 7 speakers.",366
2,I received my movie in a timely manner. It was in excellent condition. I enjoyed watching it. It is one of my favorite movies. I would recommend buying from Amazon all the time. I'm hooked!!,190

2,To let you know screen surfers are people that use the map to find people and slaughter them. This is the greatest FPS ever exellent graphics great guns everything is great. If you are going to play online you need to be really good or have an invincibility code because if you don't you'll be blown to bits like me.,316
2,"That this is my 2nd one and both of them don't latch very well. The outer latch basically just lays there and doesn't actually latch close the tooth. Not a big deal, just be aware of this. The interior hidden pocket area closes securely. My 7 year old has loved his for years and coins the size of a gold dollar coin and smaller will fit in the compartment where the tooth goes. Anything larger can just sit on top of the inner compartment, but again, this is where the defective outer latch may become a slight issue...it truly glows in the dark - a fun bonus!",561
2,It is quite an elegant piece of work...I like it very much....it is rich looking and I believe any woman who smokes would love it. I thought it was a tight fit at first for the Kool 100's box but it ended fitting ok so everything is good.,238
2,"This is Clint Eastwood at his finest as opposed to talking to a chair at the Republican National Convention. The movie is exciting, fun, and funny in places with a great sound track. It's a must see for Western fans. It's almost as good as Unforgiven.",251
2,"This is a WONDERFUL product. It works tremendously well. Do not follow the advice on the box to use peanut butter as the bait. Use bread crumbs or cookie crumbs, and make sure to leave some around the entrance to the trap as well. The electric shock instantly kills the mice. While not as humane as no-kill traps, you don't have to peel a suffocated mouse of a glue trap, or scrap a mouse with a broken neck of a traditional mouse trap. Buy it. Use it. Be mouse free.",467
2,"Disc one has a glitch in one of the first two episodes which could be the result of, in this case, the disc coming loose in the box during shipping and becoming scratched while floating loose.",192
2,"My daughter loved this costume. The only problem was the boot covers were SO tall! They went all the way up her thighs. No problem though, it was cold out so we just used her pink sparkly snow boots instead.",207
2,"Hehehehehe... How many of you have played Perfect Dark? Ok, how many of you have planted about 1000 mines and then watched in dismay as the only thing it does beyond the explosion is scorch the wall? The first thing I'm going to do in this game is blow everything up in a level. I'm going to see how far I can dig a hole with mines. I'm going to make a peep hole to snipe people with my guns........",399
2,"This book feels a gap between high level tutorials that do not get into any kind of technical details and the actual specification documents that can be overwhelming at first sight.The first part of the book is an overview of video coding and provide a technical description of important tool used in video coding such as DCT transform, motion estimation, motion compensation etc.The second part of the book focus on the specifics of MPEG-4 and H.264.More focus on the H.264 part would have been welcome.",504
2,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. Yes it's incredibly hard to watch, but it's worth it. This is one movie in the world everyone should see. It is very eye opening, and thought provoking. Unlike many other animal rights movies, this one actually makes the strongest argument I have heard. I am now a vegetarian. BUY IT WATCH IT!",329
2,After having a Mr Coffee we decided to see if a high end machine made any difference. Why did we wait so long? We have had this machine for 6 weeks. This machine deserves all the high ratings it has gotten. I liked coffee before but now truly enjoy my coffee. The overall quality of the machine is very high. The only negative is the very small place to pour the water in. You will not be dissappointed.,403
2,I had problems with indoor receptions with Sirius boom box external antenna so I bought this. It works very well so now I have excellent reception indoors. I installed it with the splitter for standard Satellite not HD and it works well this way I don't know how well it would affect HD reception for the TV if at all. I am very pleased with this unit.,352
2,"I do not know the books. But the movie is well made, It just lacks originality. You get the feeling you saw those things before. I suppose with so many movies around it is hard to be original. However, the movie does hold the viewer interest and has good entertainment value. I wish the fight scenes would have been toned-down to accommodate a wider range of audience.",368
2,"Great soundtrack. It is rare that the music playing on a movie stands out to me, but this one sure did. However, there were a few songs in the movie that aren't listed on the soundtrack and I would like to know what they are as I found the music credits shown at the end of the movie to be pretty illegible. Can anyone please help?",331
2,I used this book to help me set the table as well as for the recipes inside. I couldn't have had my Seder without it.,117
2,I thought the message about a mother's love for her child was very well expressed in this story. I especially liked the ending when the father could relate those same feelings for his own child.,194

2,"This album is another supreme demonstration of Khayree's ability to create and Dubees ability to pimp, not on the streets though. Dubees ability to comically create as in ""Throw Ya Hand Up"" and educate the P.H.ers how game can be tightly laced. Mac Dre once said ""Khayree and I are like peanut butter and jelly"", with the addition of Dubee to YBB, they all come together like bread.",382
2,It's great to be able to go into my closet and not waste time searching for that elusive pair of shoes that I wear once a year. The price was very reasonable and the boxes are well made. I'm planning on ordering another twenty boxes for my daughter's shoes. Some of the boxes I used to store Lego? pieces in my son's room. ***** 5 stars,336
2,"Exactly that. It's over-long, badly written, and you still don't care because you just HAVE to know what's over the next page. Just a shame that the wait for the next (hopefully concluding) volume is so long.",208
2,"The unit is easy to use, convenient. Cord wrap up is great. Nice size to sit on your cabinet. I use for grinding my Flax Seeds I take daily for health. It's the perfect size for daily usage to grind the flax seeds. Excellent for small quanity .",244

2,"This film manages to be action filled and sweet at the same time. Another great Studio Ghibli film with several characters reprising their roles from Ghibli's ""Whisper of the Heart.""",182
2,"I love this product. I don't think that it works as well as Cauladlie's Whitening Serum, but it's a cheaper way to keeep my ivory color going after using a dose of the more expensive brand. This lasts forever! I will definitely keep alternating with my Caudalie. Perfect product!",279
2,"Britney Spear's new single, ""Baby one more time"" is a song with a deep bass line and a great chorus. Her wonderful voice carries you to the end, like on those cartoons where the guy smells a pie and is lifted off his feet and he floats to it. That's what this song is like. You'll like Britney if you if Robyn, the girl who sings ""Show me Love."" I have had the chance to see part of the video for this song and it is sure to be a hit too! I can't wait for the rest of the CD to come out!! Good Luck Britney!",507
2,"I thought this was an outstanding book, so well researched before their trip and so well written describing the areas, the problems encountered and their combined solutions to those situations. I've met Walter Nelson, Mr. Preston's partner on the trip, and that made me understand their friendship and their determination to make it happen even more. It was a great book and I highly recommend to anyone interested in the history of the Western United States.",459
2,"I think that this is a super book, both for the recipes and the information. The chapters are divided by food type and health benefits. There is also a helpful ""pantry list"" at the front of the book. Most of the recipes I have tried have been excellent; and I felt good about eating them after reading about the benefits to my body. The only complaint I have had is that some of the recipes have tasted rather bland - a bit too ""healthy"". However, you can always make alterations to adjust the taste to your liking.",515
2,I thought the book Sounder was interesting.It kept me guessing about the parts.Like when part of the jail had blowN up. I thought the dad wasn't going to survive.To my suprise he did. Then when he came home half paralized that really suprised me.After all the interesting parts and all the exitement it was good.Although the part I didn't like was when both Sounder and his master died.They could at least lived for anothor year together.Besides that I really liked the book.,475
2,"I just discovered Barry Farms rice, including the Brown Jasmine. It was very good, flavorful. Barry Farms is a pleasure to deal with. My entire order included other brown rice types, each bagged individually in an airtight bag and then all of those bags inside another heavy duty plastic bag.

This is the first online company I have ordered gourmet food from and I have not been disappointed. I will be back.",518

2,"Great product. Very happy! Just remember these pills are 1000mg but only contain 300mg of fish oil in each pill!! Read labels! So in order to get 1200mg of omegas that you need a day you should be taking four pills a day. Two in morning, two with lunch.",253
2,"The only thing that I have is that I just cannot adjust the volume. People always complain that I am not loud enough or sounds like I am talking far away from the machine. Other than that, I am very satisfied with the product.",226

2,"I bought this sharpener to keep all of our kitchen knives sharp along with my pocket knives. It works well once you get used to it. Holding the blade against the outside of the sharpener edge every stroke seems to be the trick. Also, if you have a sharpening steel, once you have sharpened in the machine, you hit the blade once or twice on the steel and you usually have a razor sharp edge. Works pretty good.",410
2,my rate of this item is great!! fantastic!! couldnt complain about dc comics!!! cartoons bringin our favorite heroes to life!!!! 5 stars!!!,139

2,"I am only half way thru but I can't put this book down. It's about the struggle between England, Ireland and America. Right now it's dealing with the potatoe famine and the people of Ireland being evicted off the farms because they arn't producing. Fever has struck and they are dying by the thousands. Very moving and sad but their is also a few love interest going on. Well, back to my book.",393
2,liberty x is a band made up five talented singers who lost out to the pop act hearsay on the british version of popstars. Now their back with a #1 hit single. The song has a very pop/rnb sound to it. This song makes you want to get up and dance to it. I recomend this cd for pop fans all over.,293

2,"I bought a wide aspect ratio LCD monitor so that I could have more room to work when doing digital painting, and getting the 4:3 aspect ratio of the tablet to map to the screen makes the vertical tracking seem like it's dragging. I had to resize the tablet mapping area to something around 3x5 inches to make it feel more natural. The obvious drawback is that there is a much smaller workable area on the tablet surface.",420
2,"My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved the table and chair set. It is the first Christmas gift that she went for!! Her father, my son had no problems with assembly, and everything was numbered and easy to follow. The only thing that I was a little disappointed with is that there were no screw caps/dollies which did take a little bit away from the looks of the chairs as they stuck out in the backs of all of the chairs.. Otherwise, for the money, it was made very well and seems to be very sturdy.",498

2,"Easy set-up and fit my Infiniti G35 Coupe without issue, even with the spoiler. Incredibly stable, even on long trips at 65 mph. Only issue was a broken tack weld (it happens) but I received a new unit within 2 days. Well worth the money and beats having to take the front tire off and stuffing the bike inside the car/trunk. Make sure the straps are tight AND the area is clean where the foam contacts the body.",412
2,Brutal and intense is how I describe this movie. Definitely not a film for everyone. Thought provoking. Mother Nature does not discriminate. No discussion. One must accept the harsh reality that wilderness can offer. I could relate to this movie because of my own personal interests and experiences with the outdoors. Please do not allow children to watch.,356

I only wish the jog wheel rotated instead of being fixed...then it would be perfect!",482
2,"This band certainly appears to be a reincarnation of the Alegre All Stars (it features most of the legendary musicians who were key players in the 1960s Allegre sessions). Featuring the late great sonero Chivirico Davila and Paquito Guzman on vocals with a killer rhythm section this is smokin' classic ""Salsa Dura"" at its glorious best.

2,"I totally LOVE this product. They are time consuming to make up BUT well worth it.Once the centers are made up, they are easy to maintain. I would highly suggest laminating the pieces. I did and they have held up very well. My students loved doing them. I would recommend for any teachers. Many times I used these as a reward for getting work done in class early. Students were able to pick what they wanted to do after completing their assignments.",449

2,I enjoyed it a lot and recommend watching if you like covert war movies that have Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts in it.,116
2,The best for your hardwood floors - it maintains the natural luster without a oily finish. Cleans the floor without heavy scrubbing and you should try not to use soap and water on wood finishes so this is a great product.,221
2,You don't really need them but the subtitles would be nice. Catch up Amazon! But Doc Martin never disappoints. Great series! Highly recommend it.,145
2,"I picked up Life of Pi expecting a very different story than the one I received. Through it, I experienced many true trials, starvation of a soul, a burning desire for life and a more intimate knowledge of the spiraling ways of the natural world. Every page was written eloquently, the imagery is rich and vivid. I was enraptured through the entire story.I highly recommend this book, give it a chance and prepare to be astonished.",431
2,"Just loved the cook book. When you read it, it sounds like Racheal Ray! If you know her show, you will know that it was written by her!",135
2,This was my first foray into jazz piano and I was not disappointed. I've added this and the Best of Duke Ellington to my weekend morning's playlist.,148
2,I love this book. It has alot of excellent information to help people who are suffering from depression. I am a yoga teacher and find that the poses they suggest are wonderful to relieve many symptoms of sadness. I purchased 2 additional book for my girlfriends.,262
2,"This is unlike anything I have ever read. It remains as shocking, in many ways, today as it did when originally released. This is a unique literary effort that also happens to be strongly illustrated.",200
2,Very good buy(bought two)-both girls love their games and enjoy different levels of play that are included in the games.Kept them quiet at the airport and the next day the 3 yr. olds pre-school teacher was tripping out when they did computer games at school-she knew more than I had taught her because of the leapster games!,324
2,"I bet the last person who posted was first in line to cash his 6 bucks though right? Make some sense dude, seriously. Your crying because you say you didnt get enough back, well how much in taxes did you PAY into before the tax credit!? Thought so.Good book overall. Sean has alot of topics correct. Sometimes I cant take his strong conservative beliefs. Sean, take a breathe once in a while will you!? A little too much preaching but overall a good read.",455
2,"Great little devotional book. Nothing too in-depth, but nice short devos that a busy mom can easily add to her day. I like Lisa Whelchel and have been impressed with her other books as well.",190
2,"I have been a fan of the series since I first saw it on TV as a kid. My Dad and I would laugh and laugh at the well written dialog and cheesy jokes. What an amazing idea for a Sci-fi series, intergalactic garbage man with a wacky crew. I love every episode and was so sad when it was cancelled. I highly recommend this series to every Sci-fi comedy fan.",353
2,"I've probably read over 100 musician biographies and autobiographies. So far, this is the best. It almost reads like a letter from a friend. It's candid and honest, with Smokey's talent for words sprinkled throughout. You can hear the music in his thoughts.There are more than enough names and dates to satisfy ones need for the events of Smokey's life, but they're embraced by his words. I couldn't put it down.I'll be seeing Smokey in concert on 08/11, and I'm certain that this book will only bring me closer to the man on stage.Enjoy!",538
2,"Most people I've come encountered with who have seen this movie generally have the same impression, 'not bad'. It's one of those movies that is not Oscar contention but you still come out of it feeling like you enjoyed it. It has some fresh faces to the screen and a fresh story line that hasn't been over-used. It's a feel good movie with some substance but nothing too deep, where in the end you just want to go dance.",420
2,"Folk tales of a famous witch or voodoo queen in Louisiana. She was from Haiti, so there is conflict with the Christian environment.1956, 96pp, with a bibiliography in back and several page on how to read palms. Hard to find.",224
2,"With all the criticisms of Presidents Jefferson and Madison among the pointed head crowds of academics and historians, this book is a refreshing reminder about what a first rate mind and one who was closer to the scene than we are thought about the two Presidents; namely, Henry Adams. The book serves to reintroduce Adams to the American reading public as well as teach it early American history and how became what we are. I recommend purchasing the book.",457
2,"Billy has moved on. Unfortunately, a lot of Pumpkins fans cannot. They are stuck in their lame 90's warp. Corgan went on to write more sweeter and humbler material that shows a progression and status of where in life he's at. The best songs: Yeah, Come With Me, Honestly, and Heartsong. I gave this 5 stars but the Jesus I track should have been edited some instead of the full 14 minutes. With the breakup of the short-lived band, thankfully I plenty of bootlegs to last me. :D",478
2,I love these yoga pants because they are cotton so they breath when you sweat and they are light weight. The color is great too!,128
2,"I bought this book for my daughter, a senior in High School. She used it to confirm that her skill set really is appropriate for the major, Business, she is interested in. It's a useful book and we recommend it.",211
2,The book arrived in record time. I was very pleased with the condition of the book. There was one problem with book. The book contained a password to links on the web. This password had expired and I had a hard time obtaining a new one.,236
2,This cd is fantastic...A must have for 2004. Brandy is back and in a big way...An Amazing cd. Everyone should go out and cop it.,128
2,I really enjoyed and still enjoy this double cd. Having this compilation playing in the car this is the kind of music that relaxes you and that brings back memories from the 80'S. Thanks to the great talent of this artist!Pity that the song 'I want you' jumps when playing but I guess this is to remind you that perfect happiness is impossible to achieve!,355
2,"Hallesby pre-supposed that a ""spirit of prayer"" grows in every believer (this seems true in my case).The book identifies natural human hindrances to this growth so that we can cooperate with the Spirit, clear them out, and pray.If you feel a longing for prayer, grab a copy of this book.",287
2,"The Red Arrows have received acclaim as the RAF's most famous aerobatic display team and have an international following, so THE RED ARROWS STORY is a top pick for any serious military aviation collection and many a public library holding. Its slim appearance masks a virtual treasure trove of information, from vintage black and white photos and history to contemporary modern color shots of the Red Arrows in aerial action. A 'must' for any serious military aviation collection!",480
2,"This cd is probably one of the best purchases you'll make this year if you're into this stuff. Although a little repetitive at times (but how many bands aren't somewhat anyway yet still good?!), the sheer volume of highly listenable crushing energy released makes it all worthwhile. I don't how they maintain such a high level either naturally or on dexies or something ;-P, but if you need a good shock to the system and wake up call from this eF'd up Matrix we call Life, this is just the ticket! Left for Dead and The Better Half of Forever just kill!",554
2,"Although married to another, Liz Townsend has never forgotten her first love, Senator Adam MacKenzie, who years ago chose a life in the political spotlight over her. Then fate brings them together again and Liz realizes that Adam's passion for her has never faded.",264
2,"I hadn't seen this movie in probably over ten years, and even when I saw it in tv today it still brought me to tears, a compelling story and breathtaking music wrap it all together.",181
2,I enjoyed this movie. It was good to see a different twist on an old Christmas favorite.,88
2,This is a great buy. I purchased it for my husband and he loves it! Looks exactly like the picture and it works great!,118
2,The movies were better than we expected. In perfect condition. We got it much faster than expected!! Couldn't have gotten any better.Thank you!!!!,146
2,"Allthough the sound track is less than proffesional and there is only one camera, the music is really great.Master Class",120
2,"They are very compact speakers which will fit onto any computer table. The sub-woofer does not have a bass/treble control, but they can be perfectly confgured by any software.But great sounding speakers with great looks!!!Should buy if you are looking for something under [$$$]",277
2,"This is pretty neat but the instruction book could be a little better. I like how you can design the time screen with the numbers you want to look at (heart rate, distance, etc.).",179
2,"I just got this oil because I repair fans and such so I need something like this. I'm also blind and call me stupid but I can't figure out how to open the darned thing. It doesn't seem to be easy, wished I just would of bought some spray oil",241
2,"Most pure badger hair brushes on the market sell for at least $50, so this is a bargain compared to most. For the first week, my brush shed a little; however, this stopped after the first week. I have been happy with the brush, especially considering the price. I would recommend this brush for anyone who thinks they want to start using a shaving brush. This is a good, inexpensive way to ""test the waters"". Then, if you find that you will continue using a shaving brush, I would recommend buying a higher-end brush.",517
2,"Buy it. It's the best hatchet I've owned. Sharp as a razor and light as a feather. Strong, durable.",99
2,"For a man or a woman....this is a wonderful, light & refreshing fragrance which willhave any one around you asking, ""What is that wonderful cologne you are wearing?""",165
2,This is being used almost daily and has been a real hit. Previously prescription patches were being used and these produce better results.,138
2,The item came quickly and is exactly as advertised - I am very happy with the service.,86
2,"These bottles really work! I was skeptical at first, but my son actually seems to have less gas after eating from these bottles. I found the same results from Avent bottles, but those cost more. The only downside to these is that each bottle has 5 parts, so if you don't have a dishwasher they would be pain to clean. You should also know that if you plan to pump into these bottles you will need an adapter.",408
2,This book is true and accurate and should alert anyone who reads it about what has happened in Europe and is evolving here in the great USA.,140
2,"This is a good Christmas movie. One of those ""The Grass isn't always greener"" kind of movies that gets you thinking.",116
2,"SO awesme, play a King and lay waste to your enemies! Stunning graphics, excellent game style and learning curve. If you dig strategy and tactics this is your game",163
2,"This is the best how-to book on getting rid of pain caused by injury, stress, or physical problems. The premise is that when a muscle is injured, it never forgets, creating a ""trigger point"". This book tells you step by step how to find the ""trigger point"" for your specific pain, and how to apply counter pressure to relieve the pain. I have disc problems in my back, and when my back acts up, this relieves the pain and gets me going instantly, without drugs or chiropractors. I highly recommend this book.",508
2,"Came within two days. Very easy to hook up. So far (2 months) it is working quite well. It is a little noisy and makes you wonder if it will be able to load paper, but it does. Printing is pretty fast and the fax worked well on both receiving and sending.",255
2,Lots of fun for my 8 year old. She is hooked on these books. Love the pictures and riddles. Keeps the brain fresh looking for items. Fun.,137
2,This is another very good album by Paradise Lost. I am used to hearing very good albums by them. i don't know but i think that the vocals sounds like James Hetfield. The guitars are very rhythmic as always and with the appropriate pauses to give a feeling of porosity. Its a little bit melancholic but very good. The production is very good and i adore the sound of the drums (one of the best sounds i have ever heard) Buy this album,433
2,"very good, very good, is made &#8203;&#8203;of a material and is excellent can be used for any occasion, I received it in good time",131
2,"This is one of the best shows on tv. We don't have cable, so I have to wait for the dvd's. However, it's nice to be able to watch them several in a row and without commercials!This season has a few flaws, but nothing major. It still keeps me on the edge of my seat. Personally, I love the character development episodes just as much as the action oriented ones.",361
2,Excellent video for fans of Phoenix and of course Barkley.Charles is one of the most controversial players to ever play the game yet one of the most colorful and talented as well.Through the good times and the bad of Barkley's life and career he has always been the center of attention especially in the NBA.A must have for true fans of sports legends.,352
2,"Bigelow teas are consistantly good - rich flavor and aroma kept fresh in foil-lined wrappers. Pass up the Twinnings Earl Grey (weak) and go with this one. From an environmental standpoint, though, it bothers me to throw away so many wrappers. Earl Grey is great iced as well, which takes four bags in my iced tea maker. If Bigelow makes larger bags, to make a full pot of tea for two or a pitcher of iced, I'll get those instead next time.",439
2,"This book is revenge for ""The Official I Hate Cats Book"" and ""101 Uses For A Dead Cat"". The pictures are rather amusing. Instead of a riding a mechanical bull, there's a cat riding a ""mechanical human"". Cats have found many uses for a dead human: A ""piggy"" bank, a basketball net, dominos, a scarecrow and even a seesaw. It's a light satire and I recommend it to anyone who has a ""cat hater"" in the family.",406
2,"It Looks Great in the picture and all of the materials are HIGH quality, but if you are unsure of you're wiring skills dont buy it because it does not come assembled. EVERYTHING else is TOP-NOTCH QUALITY! I reccomend it, just unpleased when I opened the box to find a bag full of parts.",286
2,"A psychic fair, a corn maze, a murder AND stain tips...another great read from Sharon Short! Josie's finally coming into her own, her friends are a hoot, and I can't wait to see what happens with Owen. Looking forward to Sharon's next book!",240
2,This product was excatly as described. Purchased it as a Christmas gift to go with the dremmel power drill and stand.,117
2,"Although I am not a carpenter, I do a lot of my own renovations, etc. My brother-in-law has this saw and I would constantly borrow it. I finally purchased one with the integrated table and have zero regrets. It is simply fantastic.",231
2,"The definitive guide to all that is Hanson. If you love their music, their antics, or just their music, you will love this book. Heck, even if you hate the music you might like the book. Mr. Gollihare has a rare gift for writing.",229
2,"I was a little confused about this set when I first opened the box...this may seem a bit drastic, but i literally thought i was at a basketball tourney. I had to step back and realize that it was in fact a LEGO set. I have to hand it to LEGO, the realism that was put into this set is amazing...breathtaking even. this is the perfect gift for the LEGO/Basketball enthusiast on everyone's list. - dave",400
2,"I was very skeptical about spending this much money on pots & pans. But these pans were soo worth the money. I put them to the test this weekend, when I forgot oil & butter to cook breakfast with. The pan s worked wonders and did not stick when I cooked eggs, italian sausage & hashbrowns. Awesome buy!!",303
2,I really enjoyed this movie. My family hated it. I thought it was quirky and fun and a pleasure to go along for the ride. The different personalities of the band members and the small townspeople were universally recognizable. Very human. I really liked it. Not for everyone.,275
2,"Many of the movies I get from here are what I want, this one fit the Bill and I am happy.",89
2,"I was leary of the powder since I'm a liquid dye fan. However, it worked brilliantly. Our Halloween Pumpkin shirts were a lovely shade of orange. :)",148
2,"While traveling with only my computer (and no internet) for entertainment, this was fantastic. It provides action, humor, sci-fi, eye-candy, and many original lines that you can use with other brown coats. While I am sad that the season was cancelled, this is wonderful on its own.Thanks Joss Whedon for hours and hours and hours of entertainment.",347
2,"RE the person who thinks its like lemon juice. I beg to differ, Ive used lemon juice and there is no comparison to the Cell Food drops. I used to use lemon juice for detox, so I know what Im talking about. Cell food makes me feel great, and it doesn't take much. Can't take it at night or it will keep me awake for awhile.",322
2,That's it exactly it this is Capcom. If you have played Resident Evil then you already know the style of game play. If you don't like Resident Evil then stay away from this one. I enjoyed playing through this one.,213
2,"I've been listening to a lot besides jazz over the last 4 or 5 years. Praying that some radio station would catch on to all the stuff that's going on outside of the main stream. This disc was recommended by a friend and at the same time I heard the tune ""That Easy"" a while back on KCRW. She's got a great voice and the music is burnin cool.... I hope you enjoy this disc as much as I do",387
2,"This really is a wonderful anthology. Baugh is to be congratulated for his selection of Walcott poems. What is most impressive about this book is the remarkable consistency of superb and characteristic poetry from the beginnings of Walcott's career to more recent work. The themes of exile, Walcott's ambivalent relationship with the European canon, and the nature of colonialism run throughout the work. Much of this work is autobiographical, presenting Walcott's remarkable ability to translate personal experience into beautiful language and universal themes.",562
2,"I think that this book is great for the experienced programmer who wants to learn perl. Hopefully the reader has some UNIX experience and some general C or C++ knowledge, which is not necessary but helps you get through the perl syntax and commands that are similiar to the above mentiond languages. In my opinion the book is a great guide clear and concise, it tought me that perl is a lot less complex than I thought.",419
2,If you need high speed usb this is the one to get. I installed it myself with no problems. Most of the software I use requires the high speed.,142
2,This product is worth the price it has lasted longer than two of my brushes and a sponge. it does tend to absorb the make up but if you let it absorb some water then it works like a dream,187
2,"I bought these for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves them and says they are very comfortable and they look great. The only complaint is that he cannot put them on and take them off with one hand as they are wrap around. He is very loyal to Maui Jim, would never buy another brand of sunglasses.",297
2,"The Blender does a good job in terms of crushing ice, however there is room for improvement on the design of the blade for enhanced chopping & liquefying.Also, at times the rubber seal leaks, needs adjutment to stop the leak.",225

2,"As most parents do, I do my best to parent my children and even though I consider myself to be a great mom by providing for all my childrens needs, I still have room for improvement. This video allows to explain more about how children work and what it takes to create a loving relationship while teaching your child as you see fit. It highlights simple things that I found myself doing and although I thought were innocent, could be contributing to the problem more than helping. By making me stronger as a parent, it will make them stronger for their lives!",559
2,"I have it fo over a year... MY toddler whatch it about an hour a day... She carry it around, droppet it opens it, push buttons over and over and still works!!!~ I will buy it again If this one spot working!!!",208
2,"I adored this story. It was a true illustration of 1917 and of what love must endure to survive, blossom.",105
2,"I agree with all the other 5 star reviews. I have told all my friends about this toaster/egg cooker/breakfast sandwich maker. They are ordering one too. How fun and easy to be able to get your own egg mcmuffin at home. I use the whole grain muffins and brown fresh eggs, Canadian bacon from Sam's and cheese if I'm in the mood. I hate boiling eggs so this will make that extra easy. How much more could you want? Doing the happy dance.",435
2,"...BR>Both groups do a creditable job. The video quality is very good for a concert, whereas the audio is fine in AC-3 for 38 Special. But the audio for Skynrd has no center channel mix in AC-3. Nonetheless, A great buy for those of us who got to see the band in the late 70's live. Believe me they can still mix it up rather well.",331
2,"Took a long trip with weight in back and and had a smooth ride. Great product Installation was easy, and price was great. Thank you.",132
2,Gift for step mother. She loved. I think my dad got some that night.,68
2,"The Revealed books are the best. We make sure to take one every time we head to Hawaii. They are thorough and the reviews are right on. The sidenotes, stories and tidbits are a fun, educational read while on vacation too!",221

2,"""star light, star bright first star i see tonight' That starlight may well be a message from a long dead dot in space that burned itself out before our worlds existed. Its true. When you see a star's light, you don't even know if the sun that gives it to you exists anymore. Yet there it is, plainly, true light come to your eye from beyond time, beyond space, beyond imaginings. It is yours to do with as you choose. It is much the same with Opal's gift.",455
2,"My mother bought this for me. I'm on her account to tell you all about this wonderful gift.This necklace is well crafted and beautiful. The picture does not do it justice. It shipped fast and arrive in a beautiful box, just like it said.I'm glad I got this necklace today, I believe it helped save my life. I worship the Goddess Hecate as it is, but I felt her presence over me today even more so because of this necklace.

2,"Never before have I heard an album this great! this is better than anything before it, better than the Beatles, anything! Pearl Jam is incredible! I mean wow! and theyve only gotten better! Led Zeppelin was my favorite band before, but Pearl Jam replaced them in my mind and rightfully so",288
2,Very happy with this purchase. For a plastic container it is solid. The bag holder works perfect and so does the foot pedal. The shipment arrived very quickly and in good condition.,181
2,"They used to promote movies as being a every-genre combination, ""filled with action, romance, laughs and drama,"" but it never really meant anything beyond poor story telling. If a movie tried this advertising approach now, everyone would think it ridiculous and refuse to see it. The amazing thing about Hana-bi (Fireworks) is, the combination really works. To even begin supplying plot details would waste your time and degrade the movie. It is a work of art in its entirety, including the original movie poster, which I'm afraid, is not on the box cover.",556
2,I tried to get off cheap so I bought two Bonjour 3 cup coffee presses. Would you believe they made the center with plastic which deterioated and broke in three months. I have finally gotten smart and bought a real Bodum. It is all metal. I'm hoping the glass is strong and it doesn't crack.,290
2,I purchased this book for my 18 month old son. He loves to open the special doors. Open the barn door is a sweet book and stands up to my son's not so gentle approach to reading. The doors are a little tough to open for him alone as they stick. But it holds up quite well.,272
2,"I have read and enjoyed several of the Black Lace books but I must admit that this one is my favorite. It was refreshing to read an erotica story that actually had well developed characters, believable dialogue, witty humour and, very course, great sex. Lots of fun!!!",268
2,"Hiroji Kubota takes the reader on a wonderful visual feast of Japan. His photos cover all aspects of Japanese life, from the very ancient to the very modern. The captions for the photos are at the back with an accompanying black and white print of the photo.A beautiful coffee table book.",288
2,This book has changed the way I think about being a mom. I love the GIFTS and study questions after each. The text is completely scriptural based.,146
2,Great price and fast shipping. Not very strong and it's a good every day perfume formy wife. Great for if you have a baby and you don't want to irritate their skin,163
2,"Not a fad diet book but one that has proven the test of time, with scientific research and success stories to back it up.",121
2,Be aware that the picture above of a Magnum Style drill motor with the Quick-Lok power cord is NOT correct. The Model 0232-20 0-2800RPM does not come with a Quick-Lok cord although the Model 0224-1 0-1200RPM has the Quick-Lok power cord. What's up with that?I'm still going to purchase the Model 0232-20 because I need a high RPM drill but I'm also going to try to fit a Quick-Lok power cord to it. All the Magnum series drill motors seem to have the same plastic handle design so it might work.,495
2,Great handycam. Fast and easy to use. We received it at 5pm and used it at 7pm to record a concert.,99
2,This is my second Escort Passport. I have used many other brands and wish I cough up the extra $ long ago. I did like the Passport 8500x 50 blue better. (So did the thief),171
2,I've said it before and I'll say it again: Myron Bolitor and Win Lockwood are characters that I just can't get enough of. I suppose I should mention that Coben's stories zip along at a brisk pace and provide an entertaining ride. What can I say? I'm a real fan.,261
2,"I definitely think this was a good purchase, not only because of price comparisons but because the insert actually works well with most any bra and you can't even tell that it's there. I can see why it would be useful in a bathing suit or bikini top but have not tried that yet.",278
2,"However, really REALLY chocolatey, if you are a chocolate fien looking to score but you have calorie restrictions, this is your product. I have to drink it with a glass of water and brush my teeth afterwards due to it sticking to my teeth.",239
2,"This book is a fantastic read from start to finish. The ONLY issue I have is that the character Omaha could have been a little less Indiana Jones. Having his name be a State, and the author actually call him ""Indiana"" by one of the other characters is really not necessary. Other than that, I loved the whole book, and I loved the end. It will hook you in to the Sigma series.",376
2,"great info about pipe, shared memory. need some more work but overall good to have this book. It is sad that author of this book (GodFather of Unix) is no longer here. I learned very much from having this book. Some improvements have been made from earlier edition. This may not be the first book recommended for beginners.",323

2,"I installed this on my Rv to quickly disconnect the battery for storage. This with the help of a 5 watt solar charger keep my battery fully charged and always ready. This switch feels well built. You will need your own hardware ( bolts, terminals, ect) to get it installed. Get one.",282
2,"This is a great book for designers, painters and anyone that loves that era of fashion. I found it at the library and had to own it.",132
2,"I have had this blender for almost three years and use it to make smoothies often. I've never had any of the problems mentioned with it stopping after several uses, or with thick smoothies. I am missing a part (gasket) which makes it a little leaky, but it still works fine. I love that it can go in the dishwasher and, really, it is one of the sleekest blenders out there!",373
2,Bought this for my sister and she loves it. It's just the right length of time and a perfect workout.,101
2,This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. I watch it every year so I decided to buy it. love it funny and romantic,117
2,"An exceptional movie which promted me to research and read more about the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan. There are three other earlier movies from Taiwan, 'Finding Sayun,' 'The Sage Hunter' and 'Waiting for the Flying Fish.' It would be great if these were available from Amazon.",278
2,"This is a great little book, part history book, part cookbook, first aid, home improvement, survival guide, it's probably easier to list what it is not. I have over 60 cook/food books, but the Kentucky House wife is just a good book to read as it has all the relevant food stuff and a load more, really manages to create a great perspective on how the everyday essentials and luxuries of life were carved out of a strange new world. If you need to make cider, champagne, ice cream or maybe cure snake bites or toothache the secrets are all hide in here.",553

2,"An amazing amount of useful information packed into a booklet not much bigger than the average camera manual.This is one book that is to be found permanently stashed in my camera bag while out in the African bushveld.Particularly noteworthy are the chapters dealing with lenses, exposure, film types and composition. When in the field, I find myself often referring to the chapter on exposure, which is one of the clearest most concise expositions I have ever seen on the subject.",480
2,"Even though this book was as advertised, it did not contain all of the information I wanted. I experienced no problems with the return.",135
2,"Although my husband and I know we are in the minotity, we both love this film and couldn't wait to own it. I have shared it with others and I know that the secret to enjoying it is to be in a good place in your life, happy in your relationships. Unhappy people will not find it funny. Fortunately, we find it funny and endearing.",329
2,"This is a very nice addition to my Dopp kit. It is stylish, portable, and tough. It sits well on the counter in my home, holds most soaps, and matches my Merkur razor nicely. It also travels well. I see getting alot of use out of this for many years.",250
2,My daughter loves this mobile. The colorful animals have smiles and she responds enthusiastically w/ lots of coos. We use the other attachments as play toys. The music is nice and the sound quality is very good.,211
2,"This a thoroughly enjoyable journey through Jeff Lynne's Beatlesque land of Oz. Completely over the top at times but most beautifully so. A sheer delight from beginning to end. The arrangments, the harmonies, the captivating crescendos ..... just lovely. With the exception of the exclusion of 'Telephone Line' (one of the greatest narrations of the complete abject lonliness of a broken heart) this is a perfect complilation. The sonics are extremely transparent showcasing ELO's wonderful harmonies.A must for any fan.",520
2,"These headphones are cute, durable and work well. I have them for my 3 year old and they have lasted over a year. They fit his little head well and have a volume control on them that he can use easily. I didn't rate ""fun"" or ""educational"" high because - well they are headphones! Fun and education depend on what you are using them for.",336
2,"Overall this is a great CD, with high-quality recordings of great music. I was a little surprised, though, that it doesn't include one of my favorite pieces of music used in the movie: 'Berceuse' from Gabriel Fauré ""Dolly Suite"", which was used in the scene where Little Miss teaches Andrew to play the piano.",309
2,This collection of new and classic articles provides a thorough survey to the new institutionalism in Sociology. The introduction is a very broad ranging and exciting survey of recent writings in the social sciences on institutions. The chapters apply the ideas to a wide range of empirical settings from banks to universities. The book is a must have for researchers in organizational theory and management.,408
2,"This nonfiction story intertwines the building of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago and it's architects with the life of a sick seriel killer. The story is filled with interesting and complicated details regarding both, and knowing that it is based on real facts makes it even more intense. What an interesting way to learn about history and some of the best and worst men in it. Really worth reading and I could hardly put it down.",431
2,"I searched these for some time since the salon wanted to sell me a different one for $120. Anyway, I decided to give this one a try. I use got2b crazysleek to help with heat protection and smoothness, and love the results. I don't flat iron everyday, but 2-3 times per week, and get what I want.",295
2,"This is a great companion book for the movie. The pictures are bright and clear! I wish it gave more background and trivia on the making of the movie, but what it has is great!",176
2,A great advanced workout. I love the 6 pack Abs in 6 minutes it really does work! It's not an easy workout but easy doesn't get the job done. Another must have to your workout collection! In my opinion The Biggest Loser Boot Camp and SWAT Workout are two great vids to get you into your best shape ever! Plus who doesn't like Commander Tom he's amazing!,353
2,I don't know how good this group is. But my girlfriend searched the world for this CD. It might be good from what I hear about them from her.,141
2,this was the second pony pal book I read.It was good.lulu finds a pony caught in a fence. but no one is around.her stable hasn't been cleaned.so will the pony survive.I'll let you find out.,189

2,This product is helping my son and daugther learn handwriting skills a 100% better than my previous worksheets.,111
2,"This CD is very good, with the best of Episodes IV, V, & VI, but it is missing some of the essential songs from each of the movies. I have this along with the full versions for each movie, and I suggest you get those. This CD just doesn't do justice to all the music of Star Wars. Don't take me wrong, it is a very good CD but it lacks some of my favorite songs. If you want one good CD, get this, otherwise get the full soundtracks.",433
2,"This is a fine product. Soft and plush, it fits the seatbelt well and eliminates that annoying neck pinch. It makes wearing a seatbelt a comfortable experience. No more excuses for not wearing your belt. :o)I did not encounter the negative qualities that some have written about here. I highly recommend this product.",317
2,"This coconut juice is the best I found, for your money.I drink one after my workouts, and on hot days, to cool myself down.",123
2,"Berkowitz has really nailed Hell's Kitchen. You can smell the smells, hear the noise, even feel the damp coldness. I couldn't put this book down. Although short in length, it is long on story line, and generously sprikled with humor and wisecracks. You will laugh out loud, and also be very engrossed in the story. I highly recommend this book. It is not your run of the mill murder mystery",390
2,I love the pink cleats shown... there look is so bright and when your on the field the cleats just glow as you run and its so cool !! That is why i love these cleats.,166
2,"I had been buying Oops for years, carrying a little bottle of it in my toolkit for whenever I needed to remove a label or just use as a general solvent. The great thing about Oops used to be that it was gentle on many plastic surfaces of which other solvents would damage or dull the finish. Recently, Homax changed the formula to make it stronger, but that made it worthless to me because now it damages plastic surfaces. I won't buy the new formula. BTW, this is an edited review. I first gave it 5 stars, but now would only give it 1 star.",542
2,"We aren't even all the way through this but I just had to tell others that this is definately worth the small price it costs! My 5 yr. old just struggled with every other program we used, this one is just so much more natural~ She is just flowing right through it and really understanding reading! It is clear and simple to learn and teach with this book. I am just amazed how basic this book has made things...Thank You for writing it!Homeschooling mom to 5 children for 4 years!",480
2,Truly an epic documentary it made a great gift for my family now living in Alsaka. Service as always was right on time,118
2,"I`ve been living with envelopes I bought in Sams`s Club for years now and I always had to put an extra piece of tape after I sealed them because the glue wouldnt hold. These ones, however hold out great! They are the best quality envelopes I`ve seen in a long time. Price could have been better though.",302
2,I buy this book for every Bride and Groom. This book paints a good picture of what saving in your 20's can do for your retirement. It shows where money is wasted and it tells you if you set up automated savings you will not have to change your lifestyle by much. I highly reccomend it for any age.,297
2,"This has been a great game to add to our small collection of Wii games. It is something that is fun to play and fun to watch. My kids have a bunch of the songs memorized, and they beg to play it. It is a big timewaster, so it makes me crazy some days, but most video games are timewasters, I guess! Great game, great fun!!",322
2,"Beautiful book. Love the sketches coupled with the selected quotes and excerpts. Makes you feel like you're there, through the ages. A nice, before bed or coffee table book.",173
2,"Great translation of the classic CAPCOM fighter. Some small effects are missing(swinging rails on the subway, level transition seens), and the normal NINTENDO censorship(no women thugs). Capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music, but should have kept the original scores. Sound effects are perfect, even better than the SNES, and up to par with the original arcade. Graphics are awesome, Cody, Guy, and Haggar are done well.",427
2,These tracks rank very highly compared to everything that I have heard out there. The mix and the movement are outstanding. The work of this group is really great sound art. The mix of Free Your Mind is emotioanlly moving too. The 2 tracks of ACTION REACTION are really amzing and diversified. I heard another track out last week that was incredible that I am looking for.,372
2,"This camera has everything an amateur photographer could need. Lots of features that are similar to my Canon rebel G SLR camera, which makes it easy to use right out of the box. The pictures are very clear and stunning, and can be blown up quite large.The only complaint would be night-time shots, but most digital cameras can't handle night time shots very well.",363
2,"Annie Hall is a light and whimsical journey through the New York dating game. As usual, Woody Allen pokes plenty of fun at himself and Diane Keaton turns in a great performance.Basically, this is a movie about what it is like for older people to try and date while in New York City. It does not help when the man, Woody Allen, suffers from Social Anxiety Disorder. What follows is good old fashioned fun. It is laugh out loud funny at points, and generally just a feel good movie.This is one that everyone should see.",517
2,That guy who said nirvana was the worst band to ever happen to music doesn't know what he is talkling about. Nirvana is one of if not the best bands ever. This cd sounds like it was a bootleg cause it all sounds like one preformance not like song then stop then another song. Its like it would be if you were there and that is what makes it cool. If you never got to see them in concert this is then next best thing.,416
2,"I hope we'll see more of this mini movies, though it seems for a story like that, a 4 hours movie could have been better. Yet, it's a fantastic storyline, exploring new ways allowing us however to see all of our favorite teams seens over the years while the show was on.",270
2,"I was a little disappointed with the insulation with this bottle, as it seemed that it would make a big difference but it didn't. It extended the coolness of the water maybe 30 minutes. Construction is good though so all in all, not a bad bottle.",246
2,"This breadmaker is incredible! It bakes a perfect loaf everytime! It is easy to use. Cleans up like a dream.The only drawback is the bread tastes so good, you may gain weight! Yummmmmmm!",186
2,There are only two of us but we love the extra room and the quailty. A must for camping couples.,96
2,Well worth the money. Very nice quality leather. I'll buy another when this one wears out (hopefully not for a while).,118
2,"Too bad it's out of print, but I've read that the author intends to update and reprint a new edition. Based on this edition, it should be worth getting. This edition covers fallacies and when to ignore them, pressing plans, and variations of the Mariner's Star, as well as basics on ironing (or rather pressing instead of ironing).",331
2,"This show is awesome. I love the actors, they do an excellent job. Johnny Lee Miller does a wonderful job as Sherlock.",118
2,"I do not have the most discerning ear inthe world, but these speakers are great and appear to be of good quality materials. I installed them in the ceiling in several rooms throughout my house and in the eves of the roof out back, above my deck. I use them for listening to music or sports broadcasts, so I can move about the house and even outside without missing a call of the ballgame.I've had them installed for over a year now and I've not experienced any problems.",470
2,Item was received in good time and shape. Not much to say about a little phone battery.,87
2,"the price was low but the benefits are great, it works with no problem, not even with other wireless devices",108
2,"Even after reading the reviews about the poor packaging, I still went ahead with my purchase of these clamps. Needless to say, I wasn't 'shocked' when the same cardboard packaging arrived and the handles were a little beat up. I have been using a couple of bessey clamps for the past 4 years and absolutely love them. I guess the 'beat-up' look was a small trade off for the quality of the clamps. As an added bonus, I received the clamp rack to make the deal that much sweeter...",480
2,"It is Thich Nhat Hahn at his best... inviting the reader to Nirvana without having to die...lifting up and celebrating the ordinariness of a life ...not only it's connection to the one life... rather, being that life. It is another touchstone.",243
2,"My mother forced me to read this book, and I'm so glad she did. This book was great. The meaning of the book goes way beyond the rape trial, so I suggest that if you didn't like it, read it again! It will make more sense. I recommend this book to everyone.",256
2,"I agree with both sides of the coin on this one. It is a little bleak when describing life, but in reality, life is pretty bleak. As I see it, what Pema tries to get across here is that the only reason things are bleak or jubilant is because of how they are percieved. I got this book when things truly were ""falling apart"" for me. I recently gave it to my mother to read as she is recovering from surgery for cancer. I can only hope that it gives her a degree of insight as well.",480
2,A full album of tracks both written and produced by AK1200 himself... is there even the possibility of it getting less than a 5?,128
2,"I thought this video was wondefully put together. They have interviews with extremely knowledgeable people, and is very factual. It is very interesting to see how the nazis planned to bomb New York City!",203
2,"These performances by the Suk Trio are considered by many to be the definitive versions of the Dvorak trios. The recording quality is absolutely wonderful (digitally remastered analog recordings from the late 70s). Packaging is attractive, notes are informative, and the price is amazing for this benchmark 2CD set. Don't pass this one up!",339
2,"a great job by the master Airto,who's responsible for spreading the northeast brazilian music around the world.",111
2,The story of Eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and don't allow you to get completely sucked into the book. Overall its worth reading.,268
2,The Sennheiser RS-120 wireless headphones have great sound. You will hear other people mention the hiss that is inherent in most wireless headphones however I have found this is minimal with the RS-120. It also depends on the station/channel that you are listening to. The surround sound is awesome that comes thru the headphones. You can hear everything much clearer with these headphones than without them. To me that is great listening. The only drawback I have is the comfort to the ears after an hour of listening.,519
2,It sucks to see alot of people who are so closed minded about this movie. This is hands down the best foreign film i've ever seen. Theres so much symbolism and meaning I watched it 3 times in one week and discovered something new each time. great stuff,252
2,Face your fear and conquer it. Do not be deterred by naysayers who think your beliefs are not of equal value.,109
2,"I love this product it's awsome. I have to admit it is painful a little the first time, but after that the pain goes away. you'll love the feeling of your skin after you use it, very smooth and clean. I totally recommend it.",224
2,smackdown jbi is the best wrestling game. it has matches like hell in a cell table 3 stages of hell ultimate submission and etc. smackdown jbi has over 60 wrestlers when raw only has 30 something. the only thing that raw has is good graphics. in smackdown jbi u can create a taunt and u can create stables. limp bizkit comes out in a car. even though the story mode is short and u cant defend ur title in exibition smackdown jbi is still the best wrestling game.,462
2,I used this book for an OS course i took at a community college. The subject matter is voluminous and the book covers it pretty well. I wish there were solutions to the many exercise problems. This will surely help in the learning process. Some authors/publishers provide additional resources on a student companion website. While the book does have such a site - the content is not very useful at all (just a bunch of ppt slides summarizing each chapter!).Overall a great book. I learnt a lot about OS without much of a CS background,534
2,Very versitile! I use it daily! Perfect for large meals (we have 6 mouths to feed). Great for browning.,103
2,One of her best every. It is a can't put down book. This book is AWESOME!!!!!! It will keep you wondering till the end.,119
2,"Mad Jack was a fun, fast read, written in a style that a Coulter fan can quickly identify. The characters are quirky, fun and memorable. Characters from past Coulter books are revisited like old friends.",203
2,"Highly readable, well thought out plot, Beck his usual glum self. I always enjoy reading the Beck stories he is so very Swedish.",128
2,"No problems, works great! I love not feeling the pull of a cord while using my mouse.",85
2,I was looking for something to use in my coupon binder and these work great I love to use the pockets to hold coupons that don't fit in my coupon sleeves. The colors are very bright and easy to use. I would recommend these to any avid couponer or student,254
2,"I bought this book for my 4 mo. old daughter and she loves it. She likes being able to grab at the pop ups and look at the vibrant colors. I actually found myself grabbing for this book to read to her. So, it didn't take me long to decide to get her the whole collection. Of course when you see something like this book that holds your childs interest you have to just go with it.",380
2,"It's a little late, but we still have our hopes up for recieving the kit. From The description of the funnel cake kit, Both my wife and I believe the kit is well worth waiting for.",180
2,"My 5 month old loves it - and he doesn't even get how cute it is yet! Still he loves the music and he laughs uncontrollably and many scenes.I don't mind watching it, either. The tunes are pretty catchy and I end up singing them at work (an unfortunate side effect).",265
2,"This book is highly recommended for those who follow the arcane art of chuckwagon cooking. Adams displays an excellent, first-hand grasp of the subject and writes with wit and style. Buy it now!",194
2,"This book is for those of you who yearn for a very different approach to a story - it is a bit of time to clue into the approach the author is taking, but that only adds to the experience of this book ... I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys books with a bit of a twist.",276
2,"You can tell Pulley worked very hard on this album. There are no filler songs on this CD; every song is pure gold. Pulley is a great band formed a bunch of guys kicked out of other bands. (Like Scott from Ten Foot Pole.) I recommend this CD to any fan of Ten Foot Pole, Lagwagon, or any fan of true punk unlike Blink 182.",321
2,wow she is fantastic my 19 year old thought she sounded good wow this a great choise for a cd if you like patsy what a voice wow what can i say,143

2,"This Hai flat iron was the best price on the web and shipping was fast as promised. Because the price was so low I was afraid at first it might be a knock-off, but it wasn't. It works perfectly and I am very happy with it.",222
2,"This thing is nothing special, but it was solid for how inexpensive it was. Kinda reminded me of the ones at the minigolf courses. Generic and simple, but solid.",161
2,"I'm not lying. And now that I have heard some of you agree with me and have been most kind to my opinion, I can say the GOOD things about this doll.This doll is an awesome buy. (...) you can get Cloe, Dana, Meygan, and Jade. You get 3 tops, 4 bottoms, 2 jackets, and shoes.What confuses me is why MATTEL & MGA came out with a (...)head exchanging doll at the same time. I think it's not always Mattel, nor is it always MGA, but it's BOTH. BOTH have copied. How are we going to know which one? It's onmly an opinion. Thank You for respecting mine.",546
2,The style and workmanship I like the most. I wish it would come in battery movement so I don't have to wear it all the time.,124
2,"These goggles perform as advertised. I use them for squash. They are comfortable, do not fog, and handle an impact well.",120
2,"Ilyich wrote this a generation-plus ago, yet his messages resonate today. We have depersonalized our lives in so many ways, by bringing the industrial model into realms that were meant for emotion, feeling, and art. The influx of industry-thought into medicine has torn the sensitive heart from many care-givers and patients alike. His text is a bit lengthy and is repetitive in spots, and can be challenged on the facts in others. Overall, his concerns about the choices we have made socially and medically remain valid.",521
2,Junie B Jones books have been a hit at our home for many years thru many children. I would highly recommend.,108
2,"Ordinary people in extraordinary situations. That is what Stephen King likes to write about, and that is what this is. The most terrifying part, especially to those of us who love the outdoors, is that it could really happen.",225
2,"These glasses were just what I was looking for. What I love about these glasses is the style. You don't have to wear these just to shoot, you can look really GQ just about anywhere. My lenses never get foggy, I never had those dumb dents in my nose with the nose piece, and the handles almost wrap around the whole head which is awesome because they won't fall when you bend down to wipe something! lol I would recommend to get the SMOKE, they look awesome and make you look awesome and you can wear them anywhere.",514
2,"I enjoyed reading The Dahl Family Album, and looking at the pictures. Although most of these vacations took place well before my time, I enjoyed the comments of my ""older"" cousins about our dearly departed Aunt Bertha. She was a real ""gem"", and I'm glad her memory was preserved in this book. Also, may we never forget the time my mother-Karla Drexler and her sister, Virginia Clark, and her husband Emory Clark had food poisoning. How often has my mom recalled that she was ""sick as a dog"" on that trip! Fond memories for those who experience sickness on vacation!",565
2,I really enjoy time travel books and this book is no exception. It was very enjoyable to read though at times sad. I found it intersting and hard to put down as I wondered what the ending of this adventure could be. Great read for both boys and girls and insightful to the history of those who emigrated to America.,315
2,"This can opener is great. We have been using a corded one for years but did not like leaving it out on the counter. So, we had to find a place for the old one in a cabinet and get it out when we needed to open a can. Plus, we could only open the cans in one location. With the cordless can opener, we can now open cans anywhere we like. We also take it with us when we work the concession stands at ball games. And with it's compactness, it doesn't take up much space and conveniently sits out of site in the corner.",516
2,"this walker is light weight and easy to assemble and use. No heavy lifting required. It is also adjustable, so that no matter how short or how tall a person is, they can use it with no bending over. It is also great, for those of us that need a little extra help getting off the commode. I would also recommend it.",314
2,"i thought this book would never end but it eventually did.The first few chapters were boring,but then it got cofusing,then interesting,i guess if you like books were they switch bodys is cool but not 2 me its just plan creepy (...)",231
2,don't know how well they worked but have recieved no complaints from the gift recipient.,88

2,"This book was super juicy, one of the best trashy chick reads in a long time, really hits the spot! Couldn't put this baby down. Wonderfuly written.",148
2,I thought the war of the worlds was an ok book the thing's i didnt like about it was that in alot of parts in the book it dragged on and on like they just kept on running and running from the martians from mar's.Thing's i enjoyed about the book were it was cool about them breathing fire on the people at where the cylinder first fell.I also liked the times when the martians started destroying everything but it dragged on alot.Ialso enjoyed when the army came and tried to shoot down the martians but nothing happend.,519
2,"My son loved it when he was 2 and still loves it at 6. Now my 2 year old daughter just loves it too. What kid has never gone ""boneless"" when they get upset? That was my favorite part and still is. I crack up at the part every time I read it to my kids....and they just think it's funny that I think it's funny. It's a unique picture book with a very appealing bunch of characters.",380
2,"I've read most of the Military Science fiction staples, and this book ended up being one of my favorites. I really enjoy the author's writing style, offering a humorous point of view of the main character. I've finished the entire 5 book series, and it ended up being one of my favorite military science fiction book series, maybe the best right now. This is one of those books that is hard to put down. And the story and writing are really well done.",451
2,"This is the second Gerber product I bought. Both products exceeded my expectations. First off this knife is very light, almost all the weight is the blade and thats really the way an everyday carrying knife should be. The handle fits my hand well and seems study enough, would probably be stronger if thicker. The blade came sharp, but sharp is relative . Its not carbons steel so it wont stay sharp forever. Bottom line this knife is sturdy, feels like it can take some abuse, and at less than $20 if it breaks, you can always get another one.",544
2,"An excellent all-purpose fry pan and a good value for the price. Comfortable to handle, and a nice weight without being too heavy to handle easily. T-Fal fry pans sold in the ""big-box"" stores don't seem to have the same sturdy ""feel"" as this one. Not sure if a professional restaurant chef would use it - but for home use I would recommend it without hesitation. The rim of the pan is not non-stick, so every once in a while some food might stick to the rim. Minor inconvenience.",479
